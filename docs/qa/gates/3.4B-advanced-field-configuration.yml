# Final gate summary
gate_summary: |
  This story demonstrates EXCELLENT implementation quality and proper scope management
  through strategic story splitting. The type-specific field configuration system
  (ACs 1-5) is complete, production-ready, and provides significant value to the
  engineering drawing system.

  PASS gate status reflects successful resolution of both critical issues:
  1. SCOPE-001 resolved via story split - Part 1 complete, Part 2 moved to Story 3.4C
  2. TEST-001 resolved via comprehensive test fixes - all 23 tests now passing

  The delivered components establish a solid architectural foundation with React Hook
  Form integration, 300ms debouncing optimization, and comprehensive engineering-focused
  templates. The modular design enables smooth extension in Story 3.4C for advanced
  validation features.

  Status: Story 3.4B complete and ready for integration.
