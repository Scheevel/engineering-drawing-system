summary: |
  Story 6.4 is structurally sound with comprehensive ACs and clear technical guidance.
  However, several medium-severity concerns exist around case sensitivity, concurrency
  handling, and migration testing that should be addressed during implementation.

  The story is APPROVED with CONCERNS - implementation can proceed, but dev team
  should pay special attention to the issues documented below.

issues:
  - id: "SEC-001"
    severity: "medium"
    category: "security"
    title: "Case Sensitivity in Dimension Type Validation"
    description: |
      Edge Case 6 identifies that dimension types should be case-sensitive, allowing
      "length" and "Length" as separate dimension types. This creates potential for
      user confusion and data quality issues:

      - Users may unintentionally create "Length" when "length" exists
      - Frontend UI shows "Length" but backend stores "length"
      - Export column naming becomes ambiguous

      Risk: Medium confusion for users, potential data quality issues

    recommendation: |
      Implement case-INSENSITIVE validation:

      1. Backend validation function should use `.lower()` comparison:
         ```python
         existing = query.filter(
             ComponentDimension.component_id == component_id,
             func.lower(ComponentDimension.dimension_type) == dimension_type.lower()
         ).first()
         ```

      2. Frontend should normalize dimension_type to lowercase before submission

      3. Update Edge Case 6 test to verify case-insensitive prevention

      This prevents "length" and "Length" from coexisting, reducing confusion.

  - id: "REL-001"
    severity: "medium"
    category: "reliability"
    title: "Concurrent Dimension Creation Race Condition"
    description: |
      Edge Case 4 mentions concurrent creation but doesn't specify detailed handling.
      Two users could simultaneously:

      1. Fetch component dimensions (neither sees "length")
      2. Both validate "length" as available
      3. Both attempt to create "length" dimension
      4. Without proper locking, both could succeed

      Current implementation relies on application-level validation only, which is
      susceptible to race conditions.

    recommendation: |
      Implement database-level protection (AC6 - unique constraint) as MANDATORY, not optional:

      1. Add unique constraint in migration:
         ```sql
         CREATE UNIQUE CONSTRAINT uq_component_dimension_type
         ON component_dimensions (component_id, LOWER(dimension_type));
         ```

      2. Handle database constraint violation in API:
         ```python
         except IntegrityError as e:
             if 'uq_component_dimension_type' in str(e):
                 raise HTTPException(400, "Dimension type already exists")
             raise
         ```

      This provides defense-in-depth against race conditions.

  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: "low"
    category: "testing"
    title: "Database Migration Testing Strategy Undefined"
    description: |
      AC6 proposes adding a unique constraint but doesn't specify migration testing:

      - How to test migration with existing duplicate data?
      - Should migration fail or warn if duplicates exist?
      - What's the rollback strategy if constraint fails?

      The cleanup script is marked "optional" but may be required before migration.

    recommendation: |
      Document migration testing strategy:

      1. Pre-migration: Run duplicate detection query, generate report
      2. If duplicates exist: Require running cleanup script first
      3. Migration should include pre-check:
         ```python
         def upgrade():
             # Check for existing duplicates
             result = op.get_bind().execute("""
                 SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (
                     SELECT component_id, dimension_type, COUNT(*)
                     FROM component_dimensions
                     GROUP BY component_id, dimension_type
                     HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
                 ) dupes
             """).scalar()

             if result > 0:
                 raise Exception(f"Found {result} duplicate dimension types. Run cleanup script first.")

             op.create_unique_constraint(...)
         ```

      4. Add migration test in test suite

strengths:
  - "Comprehensive acceptance criteria covering functional, technical, and integration requirements"
  - "Clear implementation code examples for both frontend and backend"
  - "Edge cases thoroughly documented with specific test scenarios"
  - "Cleanup script provided for handling existing duplicate data"
  - "Story properly blocks Story 7.4, establishing clear dependency chain"
  - "Backward compatibility explicitly addressed (AC10)"
