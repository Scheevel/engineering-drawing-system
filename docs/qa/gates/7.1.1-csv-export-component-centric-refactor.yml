story_title: 'CSV Export - Component-Centric Data Model Refactoring'
gate: PASS with CONCERNS
status_reason: 'Core refactoring is excellent with strong unit test coverage (72.6%), but React components lack test coverage and manual QA is incomplete.'

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No authentication/authorization changes. CSV escaping handled by papaparse. Client-side only, no server-side injection risks.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Virtualization ensures DOM performance (20-25 rows). flatMap() efficient. useMemo() prevents recalculations. Warning at 300 components.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Error handling with try-catch and callbacks. Edge cases covered (zero components, zero fields). Component count validation before export.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Self-documenting code with clear naming. File-level and inline comments added. Field prefixing strategy (component_, drawing_) consistent.'

technical_notes:
  - 'Core refactoring transforms export from drawing-centric to component-centric data model'
  - 'flatMap() elegantly flattens components while excluding drawings with 0 components'
  - 'Field prefixing strategy (component_, drawing_) provides clear data origin'
  - 'URL HYPERLINK formula fixed bug from Story 7.1 (was using drawing.id for both IDs)'
  - 'Documentation exemplary with 38 specific updates in usability guide'
  - 'Unit tests explicitly validate component-centric behavior with clear test names'
  - 'Virtualization threshold changed from 300 drawings to 300 components'
  - 'All 10 acceptance criteria validated (AC 10 optional and not implemented)'
