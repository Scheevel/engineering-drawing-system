nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Uses existing auth/permissions. Field validated via Pydantic (max 50 chars). No injection risk."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Single field addition. No measurable impact. Production build successful."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Existing error handling applies. Database constraints in place. Standard rollback available."
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Minor concerns: Manual response builder pattern (caused regression), COMPONENT_TYPES duplication, MUI test infrastructure limitations. All documented for future improvement."

  future:
    - action: "Refactor response builder to use Pydantic auto-serialization (model_validate with ORM mode)"
      refs:
        - "backend/app/services/flexible_component_service.py:394-413"
      priority: "Medium"
      rationale: "Prevents future regressions like this one by eliminating manual field mapping"

    - action: "Extract COMPONENT_TYPES to shared constant file"
      refs:
        - "frontend/src/components/flexible/FlexibleComponentCard.tsx"
        - "frontend/src/components/ComponentDetailModal.tsx"
      priority: "Low"
      rationale: "Will be addressed in Story 3.15 as part of schema system improvements"

    - action: "Improve MUI Select test infrastructure for unit tests"
      refs:
        - "frontend/src/components/flexible/FlexibleComponentCard.componentType.test.tsx"
      priority: "Low"
      rationale: "Investigate Playwright component tests or user-event library. Not blocking - E2E coverage is sufficient."

# Root Cause Analysis
bug_analysis:
  issue: "Backend response builder missing component_type field"
  location: "backend/app/services/flexible_component_service.py:398"
  root_cause: "_component_to_flexible_response() method manually constructs response dictionaries. New field was added to Pydantic models but forgotten in manual builder."
  fix_applied: "Added 'component_type': component.component_type, to response_data dictionary"
  fix_quality: "Excellent - single-line fix following existing patterns"
  prevention: "Future refactor to Pydantic auto-serialization recommended"
