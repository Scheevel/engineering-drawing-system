gate_decision_rationale: |
  This story represents exemplary implementation quality with comprehensive requirements
  traceability and clean architecture. All 40 acceptance criteria are implemented and
  documented with clear FR-X AC comments.

  The CONCERNS gate is issued due to test coverage gap in Phase 2 & 3 features. While
  Phase 1 has excellent test coverage (145+ test cases across 4 test files), the
  critical features added in Phase 2 & 3 lack validation:

  - Dirty state detection (critical for preventing data loss)
  - Multi-select field type (new functionality)
  - Schema deletion workflows (safety-critical)
  - Default schema protection UI (security-relevant)

  Risk-based testing principles require comprehensive test coverage for these features
  before production deployment. The implementation code quality is excellent, so test
  creation should be straightforward.

  Recommendation: Add Phase 2 & 3 tests (estimated 3-5 days) before production release.
  Implementation can proceed to merge/staging with this gate, but production deployment
  should be blocked until test coverage is complete.

next_steps:
  - 'Dev: Create integration tests for useSchemaDirtyState hook'
  - 'Dev: Add E2E tests for multi-select field workflow'
  - 'Dev: Create integration tests for deletion workflows'
  - 'Dev: Update story File List with any files modified during this session'
  - 'Dev: Run all new tests to ensure they pass'
  - 'QA: Re-review after tests added (expect PASS gate)'
  - 'Team: Decide if production deployment waits for tests or proceeds with known gap'
