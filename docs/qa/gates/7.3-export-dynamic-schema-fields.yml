nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No new attack surface. CSV export uses Papa Parse (prevents injection). Type checking prevents prototype pollution.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'O(n√óm) complexity acceptable. Minimal overhead (<5ms for 100 components). No blocking operations.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Graceful null/undefined handling. Type checking. Backward compatible. 25/25 tests passing.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Self-documenting code with inline comments. Minimal changes (19 lines). Comprehensive tests serve as documentation.'

code_quality:
  rating: 95
  strengths:
    - 'Minimal surface area (19 lines changed across 2 functions)'
    - 'Self-documenting with inline sparse matrix pattern comment'
    - 'Type-safe with proper TypeScript optional chaining'
    - 'Zero breaking changes, backward compatible'

design_decisions:
  - decision: 'Implemented Path 1 (Data-Driven Discovery) as specified'
