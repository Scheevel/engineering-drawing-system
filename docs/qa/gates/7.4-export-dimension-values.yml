# WAIVED: Issues acknowledged and accepted by stakeholder

summary: |
  Story 7.4 is well-structured with clear acceptance criteria and comprehensive technical
  guidance. The component-centric export architecture (from Story 7.1.1) provides a solid
  foundation for adding dimension columns.

  Several medium-severity concerns exist around test coverage, performance validation,
  and architectural decisions that should be addressed during implementation. However,
  these do not block story approval.

  The story is APPROVED with CONCERNS - implementation can proceed, but dev team should
  pay special attention to the testing and performance issues documented below.

  story_6_4_notes: |
    Story 6.4 (Prevent Duplicate Dimension Types) is marked as "Ready" but not yet
    implemented. This story is a hard prerequisite for Story 7.4 because:

    - Export requires 1:1 mapping between dimension type and CSV column
    - Without duplicate prevention, ambiguity occurs (which "length" to export?)

    RECOMMENDATION: Complete Story 6.4 implementation AND QA before starting Story 7.4.

    title: "Column Discovery Logic Test Coverage Insufficient"
    description: |
      The story describes a "two-pass approach" for column discovery (Technical Notes):
      - Pass 1: Scan all components to determine which dimension types exist
      - Pass 2: Generate CSV rows with discovered columns

      However, the Definition of Done and test strategy don't explicitly call out tests
      for this critical logic:

      - What if 100 components exist but only 1 has a "radius" dimension?
      - How to verify columns appear in correct order?
      - How to test column discovery with zero dimensions?

      Risk: Column discovery bugs could cause missing or incorrect columns in export.

    recommendation: |
      Add explicit test cases to Definition of Done:

      ```typescript
      describe('Dimension Column Discovery', () => {
        it('discovers all dimension types across sparse dataset', () => {
          // Dataset: 100 components, only 5 have "radius"
          // Verify: "Radius" column appears for all 100 rows
          // Verify: 95 components show empty string for radius
        });

        it('handles components with zero dimensions', () => {
          // Dataset: 50 components with dimensions, 50 without
          // Verify: Dimension columns appear based on first 50
          // Verify: Last 50 show empty strings for all dimension columns
        });

        it('orders dimension columns alphabetically', () => {
          // Dataset: Random dimension types (width, length, height)
          // Verify: Columns appear as Height, Length, Width
        });
      });
      ```

      Add to Definition of Done:
      - [ ] Unit tests for dimension type discovery logic
      - [ ] Sparse data edge case tested (1% of components have specific type)

    title: "Format Toggle Real-Time Update Not Explicitly Tested"
    description: |
      AC6 states "preview updates in real-time when format option changes", but the
      Definition of Done doesn't include a specific test for this behavior.

      This is critical UX functionality - users need immediate feedback when toggling
      between "Combined Format" and "Value Only" format.

      Risk: Format toggle could require full data reload, causing poor UX.

    recommendation: |
      Add specific test cases:

      ```typescript
      describe('Format Toggle', () => {
        it('updates preview without reloading data', () => {
          // Given: Preview showing "15.75 in ±0.01"
          // When: Toggle to "Value Only"
          // Then: Preview shows "15.75" without API call
          // Verify: No loading indicator appears
          // Verify: Update completes in <100ms
        });

        it('format toggle preserves other preview state', () => {
          // Given: User has scrolled to row 50
          // When: Toggle format option
          // Then: Scroll position preserved
          // And: Selected fields preserved
        });
      });
      ```

      Add to Definition of Done:
      - [ ] Format toggle updates preview without data reload
      - [ ] Format toggle performance (<100ms) verified

    severity: "medium"
    category: "performance"
    title: "Large Dataset Performance Thresholds Not Validated"
    description: |
      AC8 specifies performance requirements for 100+ components:
      - Preview renders within 2 seconds for up to 100 components
      - Export CSV generation completes within 5 seconds
      - Warning if dataset exceeds 300 components

      However, no guidance on:
      - How to generate test dataset with 100-300 components with dimensions
      - What performance degrades gracefully beyond 300 components?
      - Should there be a hard limit (e.g., 500 components)?

      Story's Test Data Requirements section only describes 19 components.

      Risk: Performance requirements cannot be validated without proper test data.

    recommendation: |
      Document performance testing strategy:

      1. Create performance test fixtures:
         - `fixtures/perf_100_components.json` (100 components, 3-5 dimensions each)
         - `fixtures/perf_300_components.json` (300 components, edge case)

      2. Add performance test to Definition of Done:
         ```typescript
         describe('Export Performance', () => {
           it('handles 100 components with dimensions within 2s', async () => {
             const start = performance.now();
             await renderExportPreview(perfFixture100);
             const duration = performance.now() - start;
             expect(duration).toBeLessThan(2000);
           });

           it('handles 300 components with graceful degradation', async () => {
             const start = performance.now();
             await renderExportPreview(perfFixture300);
             const duration = performance.now() - start;
             expect(duration).toBeLessThan(5000);
             // Verify warning message shown
             expect(screen.getByText(/large dataset/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
           });
         });
         ```

      3. Add to Definition of Done:
         - [ ] Performance test fixtures created (100 and 300 components)
         - [ ] Performance tests pass with actual timing measurements

    title: "Fractional to Decimal Conversion Strategy Unclear"
    description: |
      AC3 states: "value is converted to decimal format (e.g., 3/4 → 0.75, 15 3/4 → 15.75)"

      Technical Notes mention: "Use existing `parseFractionalInput` utility for consistency"

      However:
      - `parseFractionalInput` is for INPUT parsing, not output formatting
      - Dimension database stores `nominal_value` as decimal already
      - If fractional display_format is used, where is the conversion?

      The story conflates input parsing with display formatting.

      Risk: Low - likely a documentation issue, not a functional issue.

    recommendation: |
      Clarify conversion strategy:

      1. If `nominal_value` is stored as decimal (15.75), no conversion needed:
         - Export simply uses `dimension.nominal_value.toFixed(2)`

      2. If dimension has `display_format: "fractional"` metadata:
         - That's a UI display hint, not storage format
         - Export always uses decimal value from database

      3. Update AC3 to clarify:
         ```
         GIVEN a component has a dimension with nominal_value=15.75
         AND dimension has display_format="fractional" (UI shows "15 3/4")
         WHEN that dimension is exported
         THEN the value is exported as "15.75" (database value)
         AND fractional display format is ignored in export
         ```

      This removes ambiguity about where conversion happens.

strengths:
  - "Clear architectural decision between eager loading vs batch fetch (Option A recommended)"
  - "Two-pass column discovery approach is sound and well-explained"
  - "Format options (Combined/Value Only) provide user flexibility"
  - "Sparse data handling explicitly addressed (AC4)"
  - "Performance requirements are specific and measurable"
  - "Backward compatibility explicitly verified (AC11)"
  - "Error handling for dimension load failures (AC10)"
  - "Strong integration with existing export infrastructure (Story 7.1.1, 7.2)"

test_coverage_assessment: "concerns"
test_coverage_notes: |
  Story includes good test scenarios but with gaps:
  - ✅ Unit tests for formatting functions
  - ✅ Integration tests for export with dimensions
  - ✅ E2E test for full export workflow
  - ⚠️ Column discovery logic not explicitly tested (TEST-002)
  - ⚠️ Format toggle real-time update not explicitly tested (TEST-003)
  - ⚠️ Performance testing lacks proper fixtures (PERF-001)

  Test Data Requirements section only covers 19 components, insufficient for
  performance validation at scale (100-300 components).

nfr_assessment:
  performance: "concerns"
  performance_notes: |
    AC7 and AC8 specify clear thresholds but lack validation strategy (PERF-001).
    Recommend creating performance test fixtures and automated performance tests.

  usability: "good"
  usability_notes: |
    Format toggle provides user flexibility. Real-time preview updates (AC6) enhance UX.
    Pre-selected dimension fields (AC5) follow good defaults pattern.

  reliability: "good"
  reliability_notes: |
    Error handling (AC10) covers dimension load failures gracefully.
    Backward compatibility (AC11) ensures existing functionality unchanged.

  maintainability: "good"
  maintainability_notes: |
    Clear code examples and architectural guidance. Eager loading approach (Option A)
    is simpler than batch fetch, improving maintainability.

recommendations:
  - "Add explicit test cases for column discovery logic (TEST-002)"
  - "Add explicit test for format toggle real-time updates (TEST-003)"
