# Quality Gate Decision for Story 9.2
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "9.2"
story_title: "Search UI Refinement and Filter Fix"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "REGRESSION DISCOVERED: Filter works for Search Results but NOT for Recent Components table. URL parameter confidence_quartile=1 is displayed in Active Filters badge but Recent Components table ignores all filters. Backend /search/recent endpoint lacks filter parameter support."

top_issues:
  - id: "FILTER-002"
    severity: medium
    category: functionality
    finding: "Recent Components table ignores URL-based filters (confidence_quartile, type, project)"
    evidence: "Navigating to /search?confidence_quartile=1 shows Active Filter badge but displays components with ALL confidence levels (9%, 40%, 65%, 73%, 80%)"
    impact: "User confusion - active filter appears to be ignored on default view without search query"
    root_cause: "Backend /search/recent endpoint only accepts limit/page params (search.py:86-91), Frontend getRecentComponents() doesn't pass filters (api.ts:341-349)"
    refs: ["backend/app/api/search.py:86-101", "frontend/src/services/api.ts:341-349", "frontend/src/pages/SearchPage.tsx:410-417"]
    recommendation: "Add filter parameters to /search/recent endpoint and update frontend to pass active filters"

risk_summary:

  highest: { score: 6, item: "Filter regression on Recent Components" }
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Fix Recent Components filter support before production deployment"
    monitor:
      - "Schedule code cleanup for unused imports in next refactoring"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns - no authentication or sensitive data handling changes"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient use of useMemo for filter options, proper useEffect dependencies"
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "E2E tests validate Search Results filtering but missed Recent Components regression. Filter inconsistency creates unreliable UX - active filter badge shown but not applied to default table view."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Minor cleanup items identified but don't affect maintainability significantly"
