nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Input validation via Pydantic/FastAPI. SQL injection protected by ORM. No auth (consistent with system architecture). Error messages sanitized.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Explicit < 3 second test passes. joinedload() prevents N+1 queries. React Query caching reduces API calls. Performance validated at 500 component scale.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling. Frontend displays user-friendly error states. Logging for debugging. React Query auto-retry on failure.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clear separation of concerns. Comprehensive docstrings. 19 tests enable safe refactoring. Manual model construction well-documented with rationale.'

  test_design_notes: |
    - Integration tests cover all API behaviors (happy path, filters, edge cases, performance)
    - Unit tests validate service business logic (filtering, component counting)
    - Edge cases tested: zero components, invalid UUIDs, combined filters, timestamp validation
    - Performance test explicitly validates < 3 second requirement with assertion
    - Test design follows Given-When-Then patterns implicitly
    - No E2E tests for UI (acceptable - manual validation performed)

code_quality_highlights:
  - 'Exceptional test coverage (19 tests) with explicit performance validation'
  - 'Proper use of SQLAlchemy joinedload() for query optimization'
  - 'Manual model construction well-documented with WHY and HOW'

    severity: medium
    mitigation: 'Performance tested at 500 component scale, warning documented in story'

  - description: 'Missing frontend filter UI'
