# Quality Gate Decision - Story 6.1
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "6.1"
story_title: "Fix Drawings List Display Bug"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "All 10 ACs met with excellent code quality and comprehensive manual testing. CONCERNS reflects missing automated tests for regression prevention - pragmatically safe to ship but creates minor technical debt."

# Evidence summary
evidence:
  tests_reviewed: 18  # From QA test design document

# NFR validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security-related code touched. Fix is data extraction only."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No performance impact. Same API call, correct property access."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Fix improves reliability - data now displays correctly as expected."
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "No automated tests added. Future refactoring could reintroduce bug without test safety net."

    note: "Initial review - Excellent code quality, comprehensive manual testing (10/10 ACs verified), but no automated tests added. Pragmatic decision: safe to ship with minor technical debt."

# Additional context

  documentation_quality: "Excellent"

# Gate decision rationale (detailed)
gate_reasoning: |
  CONCERNS gate issued due to maintainability NFR not meeting ideal standard (no automated tests).

  However, this is a PRAGMATIC CONCERNS that should not block story completion:

  ✅ Strengths:
  - All 10 acceptance criteria verified with screenshot evidence
  - Code fix is surgically precise (1 word changed: drawings → items)
  - Root cause correctly identified via Network tab inspection
  - Dev documentation is comprehensive and educational
  - Manual testing was thorough following QA test design (18 scenarios)
  - Low regression risk due to minimal change scope

  ⚠️  Concerns:
  - No automated Playwright tests to prevent future regression
  - TypeScript type not explicitly defined (minor issue)

  Recommendation: Move to Done. Consider follow-up story for test automation.

  Quality Score: 90/100 (Excellent implementation with minor test coverage gap)
