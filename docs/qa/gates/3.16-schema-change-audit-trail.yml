top_issues:
  - severity: medium
    category: test_coverage
    title: 'No automated tests exist for audit system'
    description: 'Story explicitly requires unit tests (AuditService), integration tests (schema change workflow), and API tests. Zero tests implemented despite AC17 requirement.'
    suggested_owner: dev
    refs:
      - 'AC17: Test coverage for AuditService and schema change audit logic'
      - 'Story DoD: "Unit tests pass for AuditService" - UNCHECKED'
      - 'Story DoD: "Integration tests pass for schema change audit workflow" - UNCHECKED'
    recommendation: 'Write 12 P0 tests before production: 6 unit (AuditService), 4 integration (schema changes), 2 API (endpoint validation)'

  - severity: low
    category: performance
    title: 'AC18 performance requirement not validated'
    description: 'Story requires audit creation < 50ms but no performance benchmarks exist to validate this requirement.'
    suggested_owner: dev
    refs:
      - 'AC18: Performance - Audit creation completes in < 50ms'
    recommendation: 'Add performance benchmark test or remove AC18 if not critical'

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'No SQL injection (uses ORM). Auth tracking deferred (changed_by=NULL documented). No access control on audit endpoint - anyone with component ID can view history.'

  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Index on session_id added (good). Transaction overhead minimal (2 INSERTs). AC18 requires <50ms but no benchmarks exist to validate.'

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Transaction rollback on audit failure (AC6 implemented). Error logging present. Graceful degradation (audit failure blocks change, preventing silent data loss).'

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean service separation. Good inline comments. Comprehensive story documentation. Clear API contracts. Follows project coding standards.'

code_quality_notes:
  strengths:
    - 'Clean service architecture with AuditService separation'
    - 'Proper transaction integrity (audit-first with db.flush())'
    - 'Correct NULL handling for both AC4 and AC5'
    - 'Good error handling with rollback on audit failure'
    - 'Database index on session_id for performance'
    - 'Follows project coding standards (imports, naming, error patterns)'

  implementation_correctness:
    - 'All 19 ACs verified as implemented through code review'
    - 'AC4 (skip NULL) correctly implemented at line 110'
    - 'AC5 (skip same schema) correctly implemented at line 103'
    - 'AC6 (rollback on failure) correctly implemented at line 125'
    - 'No bugs found in implementation logic'

  technical_debt:
    - 'Test debt: ~8 hours to write 12 P0 tests'
    - 'Auth integration deferred (documented as "NULL for now")'
    - 'Audit retention policy deferred to future epic (acknowledged)'
