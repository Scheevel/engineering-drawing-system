allow commands: pip, grep, npm start

make a yagni folder

At the "/drawings" route, my expectation is that a clickable list of saved drawings would be visible 

If the default schema is truly hardcoded, then it should be static and not editable

How do I delete a schema?
what purpose does the looking glass serve?
Just "save" is sufficient No need for "save & return" button
The feature to delete a field from schema fails

I can't edit "piece markings" field on the component detail card

schema settings take up too much real-estate

There used to be way of creating instances, so a drawing could have the same piece marking. That functionality has disappeared, it was story 1.5
UX person. The entire schema selection part takes up too much of the form

How do I assign a drawing to a project? Or multiple projects?

/drawings, why is component count 0?
 - should provide a way of filtering by project
 - should provide a way of assigning to a project
/projects, clicking on a project should provide a method of viewing all drawings
