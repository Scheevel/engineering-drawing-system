## Frontend Architecture Details

### Component Architecture
The React frontend uses sophisticated component hierarchy designed for engineering data management:

**Component Organization:**
```
frontend/src/
âââ components/editor/          # Component editing subsystem
â   âââ ComponentBasicInfo.tsx  # Basic component data editing
â   âââ ComponentDimensions.tsx # Dimension CRUD interface  
â   âââ ComponentSpecifications.tsx # Specification CRUD interface
â   âââ ComponentHistory.tsx    # Audit trail display
âââ components/
â   âââ ComponentDetailModal.tsx    # Main editing modal (complex)
â   âââ SearchResultRow.tsx        # Search result display

âââ services/                   # API integration layer
â   âââ api.ts                 # Main API client
â   âââ componentService.ts    # Component-specific API calls
â   âââ searchService.ts       # Search API integration
âââ hooks/                     # Custom React hooks
â   âââ useComponentEditor.ts  # Component editing state logic
â   âââ useOptimisticUpdates.ts # Optimistic update patterns
â   âââ useSearchScope.ts      # Search scope management
âââ stores/                    # Global state management
    âââ searchStore.ts         # Search state and filters
    âââ uiStore.ts            # UI state (modals, notifications)
```

### State Management Architecture
Multi-layer state management optimized for component editing:

**React Query + React Hook Form Integration:** This combination enables sophisticated editing workflows with:
- **Server state caching** that survives modal open/close cycles
- **Optimistic updates** with automatic rollback on failure  
- **Form state persistence** during network operations
- **Real-time validation** without excessive API calls

**Modal-Centric Navigation:** Modal-based editing provides:
- **Context preservation** - users don't lose place in search results
- **Deep linking support** - direct URLs to component editing states
- **Progressive disclosure** - complex editing doesn't overwhelm basic workflows

### Service Layer Integration
The services layer provides consistent error handling, caching, and retry logic:

```typescript
// Component service with optimistic updates
const useComponentWithOptimisticUpdates = (componentId: string) => {
  const updateMutation = useMutation(
    (updateData: ComponentUpdateRequest) => updateComponent(componentId, updateData),
    {
      // Optimistic update
      onMutate: async (updateData) => {
        await queryClient.cancelQueries(['component', componentId]);
        const previousData = queryClient.getQueryData(['component', componentId]);
        queryClient.setQueryData(['component', componentId], (old: Component) => ({
          ...old, ...updateData, updated_at: new Date().toISOString()
        }));
        return { previousData };
      },
      // Rollback on error
      onError: (error, updateData, context) => {
        if (context?.previousData) {
          queryClient.setQueryData(['component', componentId], context.previousData);
        }
      }
    }
  );
};
```

## Backend Architecture Details

### Service Architecture

**Service Organization:**
- **API Layer:** FastAPI route handlers for HTTP request/response management
- **Service Layer:** Business logic with validation pipelines and integration orchestration
- **Repository Layer:** Data access abstraction with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Background Tasks:** Celery workers for OCR processing and search indexing

### Database Architecture  
PostgreSQL + PostGIS providing relational data management and spatial capabilities:

**Core Schema Design:**
```sql
-- Components table with spatial capabilities
CREATE TABLE components (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    drawing_id UUID REFERENCES drawings(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    piece_mark VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    component_type VARCHAR(50),
    quantity INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    material_type VARCHAR(100),
    
    -- Spatial location data
    location_x DOUBLE PRECISION,
    location_y DOUBLE PRECISION,
    bounding_box JSON,  -- Stored as JSON coordinates
    
    -- OCR and validation metadata
    confidence_score DOUBLE PRECISION CHECK (confidence_score >= 0 AND confidence_score <= 1),
    review_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
    
    -- Audit metadata
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    
    CONSTRAINT unique_piece_mark_per_drawing UNIQUE (drawing_id, piece_mark)
);

-- Standard indexes for location and component queries
CREATE INDEX idx_components_location ON components(location_x, location_y);
CREATE INDEX idx_components_piece_mark_drawing ON components(drawing_id, piece_mark);
```

**Data Access Layer with Repository Pattern:**
```python
class ComponentService:
    async def update_component(
        self, component_id: UUID, update_data: ComponentUpdateRequest, db: Session
    ) -> Optional[ComponentResponse]:
        # 1. Validation pipeline
        validation_result = await self.validate_component_update(
            component_id, update_data, db
        )
        if not validation_result.is_valid:
            raise ValidationError(validation_result.errors)
            
        # 2. Apply updates with audit logging
        component = db.query(Component).filter(Component.id == component_id).first()
        original_values = {field: getattr(component, field) for field in update_data.dict(exclude_unset=True).keys()}
        
        # 3. Update and persist
        for field, value in update_data.dict(exclude_unset=True).items():
            setattr(component, field, value)
        db.commit()
        
        # 4. Trigger search index update
        search_service.index_component(component, db)

## Component Editing Workflow Architecture

### Modal-Based Editing Pattern
The system uses sophisticated modal-based editing that maintains context while providing comprehensive editing capabilities:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant UI as Component List
    participant M as Component Modal
    participant API as Backend API
    participant DB as Database
    participant ES as Elasticsearch

    U->>UI: Click component row
    UI->>M: Open modal with component ID
    M->>API: GET /api/components/{id}
    API->>DB: Query component with relations
    DB-->>API: Component + dimensions + specs
    API-->>M: Component data
    M->>M: Initialize form with data
    
    U->>M: Edit piece mark field
    M->>API: POST /api/components/{id}/validate
    API->>DB: Check duplicate piece marks
    DB-->>API: Validation result
    API-->>M: Real-time validation feedback
    
    U->>M: Save changes
    M->>M: Optimistic update (show success)
    M->>API: PUT /api/components/{id}
    API->>DB: Update component
    API->>ES: Update search index
    ES-->>API: Index updated
    DB-->>API: Update confirmed
    API-->>M: Success response
    
    Note over M: If error occurs, rollback optimistic update
```

### Validation Pipeline Architecture
Multi-stage validation ensures data integrity while providing immediate feedback:

**Stage 1: Client-Side Validation (React Hook Form)**
- Field format validation (piece mark patterns, numeric ranges)
- Required field validation
- Custom validation rules (component type constraints)

**Stage 2: Real-Time API Validation**
- Duplicate detection within drawing scope
- Business rule validation (material compatibility, component type rules)
- Cross-field validation (quantity vs. dimensions consistency)

**Stage 3: Database Constraints**
- Foreign key integrity
- Unique constraints (piece_mark per drawing)
- Check constraints (confidence_score ranges, coordinate bounds)

**Stage 4: Post-Save Processing**
- Search index synchronization
- Audit log creation
- Background validation for complex rules

### Error Handling and Recovery Patterns

```typescript
// Comprehensive error handling in component editing
const handleComponentUpdate = async (updateData: ComponentUpdateRequest) => {
  try {
    // Optimistic update
    updateUIOptimistically(updateData);
    
    const result = await componentAPI.updateComponent(componentId, updateData);
    
    // Success: sync with server response
    syncWithServerData(result.data);
    showSuccessNotification('Component updated successfully');
    
  } catch (error) {
    // Rollback optimistic update
    rollbackOptimisticUpdate();
    
    if (error.status === 409) {
      // Conflict: component was modified by another user
      showConflictDialog(error.data.conflicts);
    } else if (error.status === 422) {
      // Validation errors: show field-specific errors
      setFieldErrors(error.data.validation_errors);
    } else {
      // Network or server error: show retry option
      showRetryableError('Failed to save changes', () => handleComponentUpdate(updateData));
    }
  }
};
```

## Performance and Scalability Considerations

### Frontend Performance Optimizations
**Component Rendering:**
- React.memo() for expensive component detail modals
- Virtual scrolling for large component lists (react-window)
- Image lazy loading for drawing previews
- Bundle splitting with React.lazy() for modal components

**State Management Performance:**
- React Query background refetching with stale-while-revalidate
- Optimistic updates reduce perceived latency
- Strategic query invalidation prevents unnecessary refetches
- Local storage persistence for search filters and UI state

### Backend Performance Architecture
**Database Performance:**
```sql
-- Critical indexes for component editing
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_components_drawing_piece_mark 
    ON components(drawing_id, piece_mark);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_components_type_status 
    ON components(component_type, review_status);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_audit_log_component_timestamp 
    ON component_audit_logs(component_id, created_at DESC);

-- Spatial indexes for location queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_components_location_gist 
    ON components USING GIST(location_point);
```

**Caching Strategy:**
- Redis caching for frequent component queries (15-minute TTL)
- Elasticsearch result caching for repeated searches
- CDN caching for drawing image previews
- Browser caching for static assets with versioning

**Async Processing:**
- Celery workers for OCR processing (prevents UI blocking)
- Background search indexing after component updates
- Batch processing for bulk component imports

### Scalability Architecture
**Horizontal Scaling Readiness:**
- Stateless API design enables load balancer distribution
- Database connection pooling with SQLAlchemy
- Redis session storage preparation for multi-instance deployment
- Container-based architecture ready for Kubernetes orchestration

**Database Scaling Strategy:**
- Read replicas for search queries and reporting
- Partitioning strategy for large drawing collections by project/date
- Archive strategy for old drawings and components
- Full-text search offloaded to Elasticsearch cluster

## Development and Debugging Architecture

### Local Development Environment
```bash
# Complete development stack startup
docker-compose up -d postgres redis elasticsearch  # Infrastructure
npm run dev                                        # Frontend dev server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000         # Backend dev server  
celery -A app.core.celery_app worker --loglevel=debug  # Background processing

# Monitoring and debugging
open http://localhost:5555  # Celery Flower task monitoring
open http://localhost:8000/docs  # API documentation and testing
```

### Debugging Tools and Techniques
**Frontend Debugging:**
- React DevTools with component state inspection
- React Query DevTools for server state debugging
- Redux DevTools for global state (if needed)
- Browser Network tab for API request/response analysis
- Console logging with structured error tracking

**Backend Debugging:**
```python
# Structured logging configuration
import logging
from app.core.config import settings

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG if settings.DEBUG else logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s - %(pathname)s:%(lineno)d'
)

# Component service debugging
logger = logging.getLogger('app.services.component')
logger.debug(f'Updating component {component_id} with data: {update_data}')
```

**Database Debugging:**
```sql
-- Performance analysis queries
SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time 
FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE query LIKE '%components%'
ORDER BY total_time DESC;

-- Component editing activity monitoring
SELECT c.piece_mark, COUNT(cal.*) as edit_count, MAX(cal.created_at) as last_edit
FROM components c
LEFT JOIN component_audit_logs cal ON c.id = cal.component_id
GROUP BY c.id, c.piece_mark
ORDER BY edit_count DESC;
```

### Testing Architecture
**Component Editing Test Strategy:**
```typescript
// Integration test for component modal editing
import { render, screen, fireEvent, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';

describe('ComponentDetailModal', () => {
  it('should handle optimistic updates with error rollback', async () => {
    // Mock API with failure response
    jest.spyOn(componentAPI, 'updateComponent').mockRejectedValue(
      new Error('Network error')
    );
    
    render(<ComponentDetailModal componentId="test-id" />);
    
    // User edits piece mark
    const pieceMarkInput = screen.getByLabelText('Piece Mark');
    fireEvent.change(pieceMarkInput, { target: { value: 'NEW_MARK' } });
    
    // Save changes
    const saveButton = screen.getByText('Save Changes');
    fireEvent.click(saveButton);
    
    // Should show optimistic update immediately
    expect(pieceMarkInput.value).toBe('NEW_MARK');
    
    // Should rollback on error and show error message
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(pieceMarkInput.value).toBe('ORIGINAL_MARK'); // Rolled back
      expect(screen.getByText('Failed to save changes')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });
});
```

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Component-Centric Data Model
**Status:** Accepted  
**Decision:** Center the entire system architecture around the Component entity rather than Drawing-centric design.

**Context:** Engineering workflows focus on finding and editing specific components (piece marks) across many drawings. The original design was drawing-centric.

**Rationale:**
- 90% of user interactions involve component search and editing
- Component relationships (dimensions, specifications) are complex and frequently accessed
- Search performance requires component-level indexing
- Audit requirements demand component-level change tracking

**Consequences:**
- â Faster component queries and editing workflows
- â More intuitive API design matching user mental models
- â Better search index design and performance
- â ï¸ More complex drawing-level operations (bulk exports)
- â ï¸ Additional complexity in maintaining drawing-component consistency

### ADR-002: Modal-Based Editing Interface
**Status:** Accepted  
**Decision:** Use modal dialogs for component editing instead of dedicated editing pages or inline editing.

**Context:** Users need to edit components while maintaining context of search results and drawing overview.

**Rationale:**
- Preserves user's place in search results or drawing view
- Enables deep linking to specific component editing states
- Supports complex editing workflows (dimensions, specifications, history)
- Provides clear visual boundaries for editing vs. viewing modes

**Consequences:**
- â Better user experience with context preservation
- â Simplified navigation patterns
- â Easier state management (modal vs. page-level state)
- â ï¸ Modal complexity increases with feature additions
- â ï¸ Mobile/tablet experience requires careful responsive design

### ADR-003: Optimistic Updates with Rollback
**Status:** Accepted  
**Decision:** Implement optimistic updates for component editing with automatic rollback on failure.

**Context:** Component editing workflows require responsive feedback, but network latency can make the interface feel sluggish.

**Rationale:**
- Perceived performance improvement for editing workflows
- Maintains data consistency through rollback mechanisms
- Reduces user friction during rapid editing sessions
- Aligns with modern web application patterns

**Consequences:**
- â Significantly improved perceived performance
- â Better user experience during slow network conditions
- â Maintains data integrity through rollback mechanisms
- â ï¸ Increased complexity in error handling and state management
- â ï¸ Requires careful testing of rollback scenarios

### ADR-004: PostgreSQL + PostGIS for Spatial Data
**Status:** Accepted  
**Decision:** Use PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension for spatial component location data instead of separate spatial database.

**Context:** Components have location coordinates within engineering drawings, and users need spatial queries for drawing visualization.

**Rationale:**
- Single database reduces operational complexity
- PostGIS provides enterprise-grade spatial capabilities
- Strong ACID guarantees for component location consistency
- Rich spatial indexing and query capabilities
- Excellent Python ecosystem integration

**Consequences:**
- â Unified data storage with spatial capabilities
- â Strong consistency guarantees for location data
- â Rich spatial query capabilities (within radius, intersections)
- â ï¸ Higher memory requirements for PostGIS extension
- â ï¸ Additional complexity in database migrations and backups
