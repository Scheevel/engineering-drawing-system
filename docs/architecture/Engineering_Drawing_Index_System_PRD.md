# Engineering Drawing Index and Analysis System
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Executive Summary

The Engineering Drawing Index and Analysis System is an AI-powered tool designed to solve critical workflow inefficiencies for railroad bridge engineers working with historical engineering drawings. The system addresses the time-consuming process of locating specific components across large sets of scanned engineering drawings and automates the extraction of dimensional data for structural calculations.

**Primary Value Proposition**: Reduce component search time from hours to seconds and automate data extraction for engineering calculations.

## Problem Statement

### Current State Pain Points

1. **Manual Component Search**: Engineers spend considerable time searching for a single piece mark (e.g., "CG3", "LD142") across hundreds of drawing sheets
2. **Fragmented Drawing Sets**: Projects contain multiple drawing types (E sheets, shop drawings, detail drawings) stored across different directories
3. **Manual Data Entry**: Dimensional data must be manually extracted from drawings and entered into Excel spreadsheets for structural calculations
4. **Legacy Format Challenges**: Drawings are typically scanned PDFs or JPEGs of hand-drawn plans from decades ago
5. **Context Loss**: No systematic way to understand relationships between master diagrams and detail sheets

### Impact
- **Time Waste**: A majority of engineering time is spent on data location rather than analysis
- **Error Prone**: Manual transcription can be problematic
- **Inefficient Collaboration**: Contractors must repeat the same search process
- **Knowledge Loss**: Expertise required to navigate drawings limits scalability
