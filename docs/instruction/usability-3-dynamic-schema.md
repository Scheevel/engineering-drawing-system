# Usability Guide: Epic Story #3 - Schema Management UI

**Document Type:** Agent Knowledge Base
**Target Audience:** BMAD Agents (Dev, QA, SM, PO)
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-30
**Epic Scope:** Stories 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.11, 3.12

## Executive Summary

Epic Story #3 delivers **dynamic schema management capabilities** that enable railroad bridge engineers to create, configure, and manage flexible component type schemas through an intuitive UI. This system replaces rigid data models with flexible, project-specific field definitions that engineers can customize for their exact requirements. **NEW:** Story 3.12 introduces automatic default schema fallback, ensuring users have immediate functionality on first application startup without encountering empty states. BMAD agents serve as UI workflow guides, helping users navigate schema creation processes, field configuration steps, schema management tasks, and the transition from default to custom schemas through clear interface directions and best practice guidance.

## Feature Catalog

### üéØ Core Schema Management (Stories 3.2, 3.3)

**WHEN TO USE:** Creating new component types, configuring project-specific schemas, managing field definitions

**AGENT EXECUTION SYNTAX:**
```bash
# Schema Navigation Commands
/components/schema                    # Navigate to schema management interface
/schemas/create                      # Navigate to new schema creation (Story 3.11)
/schemas/{id}/edit                   # Navigate to existing schema editor

# UI Workflow Guidance
"Click 'Create Schema' button"       # Start new schema creation (Story 3.11)
"Select component type from dropdown" # Choose base component type
"Configure field properties panel"   # Access field configuration interface
"Use 'Add Field' action"            # Add new field to schema
"Apply 'Save Schema' action"         # Persist schema changes
```

**WHY USE THIS:** Replaces rigid component models with flexible, engineer-defined schemas that adapt to project requirements

**HOW AGENTS SHOULD USE:**
- **Dev Agent:** Guide schema implementation through UI component integration testing

### üöÄ Default Schema Fallback (Story 3.12)

**WHEN TO USE:** First application startup, empty database scenarios, immediate component functionality

**AGENT EXECUTION SYNTAX:**
```bash
# Default Schema Recognition
"Notice 'Using default schema' message"  # Identify default schema is active
"Guide user to 'Create Schema' button"   # Transition from default to custom
"Explain default schema benefits"        # Help users understand immediate functionality

# User Transition Guidance
"Start with default schema for exploration" # Encourage immediate usage
"Create custom schema when ready"        # Guide natural progression
"Default schema provides 'notes' field"  # Explain available functionality
"Custom schemas unlock full flexibility" # Motivate schema creation
```

**WHY USE THIS:** Eliminates empty states on first startup, provides immediate component functionality without configuration barriers

**HOW AGENTS SHOULD USE:**

### üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Field Operations (Story 3.5)

**WHEN TO USE:** Complex field configurations, conditional logic, field relationships, validation rules

**AGENT EXECUTION SYNTAX:**
```bash
# Field Configuration Navigation
/schemas/{id}/fields                 # Access field management interface
/schemas/{id}/fields/new             # Create new field configuration
/schemas/{id}/fields/{fieldId}/edit  # Edit existing field

# Field Operation Guidance
"Access Field Properties panel"      # Configure field attributes

```bash
# Integration Navigation
/components/flexible                 # Access flexible component interface
/components/editor                   # Navigate to component editor integration
/drawings/{id}/components           # Access drawing-specific component schemas

# State Management Guidance
"Verify schema synchronization"      # Check state consistency
"Test component integration"         # Validate cross-component functionality
"Apply schema to existing components" # Migrate existing data
"Validate real-time updates"         # Confirm live schema changes
```

**WHY USE THIS:** Ensures seamless integration between new schema system and existing drawing/component workflows

**HOW AGENTS SHOULD USE:**
- **Dev Agent:** Validate state management integration and real-time synchronization
- **QA Agent:** Test schema integration across multiple component contexts
- **All Agents:** Guide users through schema application to existing workflows

"Refresh browser page"             # Clear temporary UI state
"Check backend connectivity"       # Verify API availability
"Navigate to /components/schema"   # Re-access schema interface

# Create Schema button not visible (Story 3.11)
"Navigate to /components/schema"   # Ensure correct starting page
"Check SchemaListView component is activated" # Verify component uncommented
"Look for blue 'Create Schema' button in top-right" # Button location
"Try direct navigation to /schemas/create" # Alternative access method

# Field configuration not saving
"Verify required field completion" # Check all mandatory fields filled
"Test 'Save Schema' button"        # Confirm save action functionality
"Check browser console for errors" # Inspect for JavaScript errors

# Schema integration issues with existing components
"Refresh /components/flexible interface" # Reset component state
"Verify schema synchronization"    # Check state management consistency
# Fallback: Navigate to /components/editor and re-apply schema
```

### Validation Commands

```bash
# Verify Implementation
"Test schema creation workflow"     # Complete end-to-end schema creation
"Validate field configuration options" # Test all field property settings
"Confirm cross-component integration" # Verify schema application functionality
```

## Integration Points

### UI Component Integration
- **FlexibleComponentCard:** Dynamic rendering based on schema definitions
- **SchemaAwareForm:** Form generation from schema field configurations
- **SchemaCreatePage:** New schema creation interface with form validation (Story 3.11)
- **SchemaListView:** Activated component for schema management with Create Schema button (Story 3.11)
- **ComponentDimensions:** Schema-driven dimension field management

## Best Practices for BMAD Agents

1. **Guide users through incremental schema building** with `"Start with basic fields, then add complexity"` to prevent overwhelming configuration
2. **Validate schema completeness before saving** (`"Check required field properties before 'Save Schema' action"`)
3. **Test schema integration immediately** for real-time validation of cross-component functionality
4. **Use field templates as starting points** with `"Select from field template options"` to accelerate schema creation
5. **Verify state synchronization** for seamless integration between schema changes and existing components
6. **Provide clear navigation guidance** to help users understand schema management interface organization
