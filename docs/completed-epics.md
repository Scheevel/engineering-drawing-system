## Epic 1: Multiple Piece Mark Instances
**Completed**: August 2025
**Quality Score**: 89/100
**Business Value**: Eliminated manual tracking of piece mark instances (G1-A, G1-B), reduced component identification errors

### Problem Solved
Engineers working with complex bridge drawings frequently encounter multiple instances of the same piece mark (e.g., multiple girders labeled "G1"). System previously treated all instances as identical, creating confusion and data management issues.

### Stories Completed
- **1.1**: Database Schema Migration - Added `instance_identifier` column with proper constraints
- **1.2**: API Layer Integration - Full API support with Pydantic models and validation
- **1.3**: Integration Testing - Comprehensive test coverage across all system layers
- **1.4**: Search Integration - Enhanced search with instance filtering and "G1-A" display format
- **1.5**: Frontend Integration - Complete UI integration with forms, displays, and validation

### Technical Implementation
- Database: `instance_identifier` column with unique constraints on (drawing_id, piece_mark, instance_identifier)
- API: Pydantic models updated with validation, backward compatibility maintained
- Search: Elasticsearch integration with instance_identifier indexing
- Frontend: Component creation/editing forms with instance_identifier input, visual differentiation throughout UI

### Key Files Modified
- Backend: `migrations/add_instance_identifier.py`, `models/database.py`, `api/components.py`, `services/component_service.py`, `services/search_service.py`
- Frontend: `ComponentCreationDialog.tsx`, `ComponentBasicInfo.tsx`, `ComponentDetailModal.tsx`, `SearchPage.tsx`, `SearchResultRow.tsx`, `DrawingContextMenu.tsx`

## Epic 3: Schema Management UI
**Completed**: September 2025
**Business Value**: Enables engineers to create and edit component type schemas through intuitive UI, eliminating manual database modifications

### Problem Solved
No UI existed for managing component type schemas. Engineers needed to request backend changes for each new component type or field definition. Schema management UI provides self-service schema creation/editing with real-time validation.

### Stories Completed
- **3.1**: Core Infrastructure Setup - API client setup, React Query configuration, routing
- **3.2**: Basic Schema Management Components - Schema list, view components, Material-UI integration
- **3.3**: Schema Creation and Basic Editing - Create/edit forms with validation
- **3.4**: Dynamic Field Management - CRUD operations for schema fields (broken into 3.4A, 3.4B, 3.4C for complexity)
- **3.7**: State Management Optimization - React Context for schema state management
- **3.8**: Integration with Existing Components - FlexibleComponentCard integration
- **3.9**: Testing Implementation - Comprehensive test suite with React Testing Library
- **3.11**: Create Schema Button Activation - Fixed button state management bug
- **3.12**: Hardcoded Schema Fallback - Graceful fallback when no default schema exists
- **3.13**: Schema Refactoring - Cleaned up schema service architecture
- **3.14**: Component Type Display Restoration - Fixed type display bug in component forms
- **3.16**: Schema Change Audit Trail - Comprehensive audit logging for schema modifications

**Note**: Stories 3.5 (Advanced Field Operations), 3.6 (Real-time Validation/Preview), and 3.10 (Styling Polish) were planned but never implemented. Functionality was delivered through other stories.

### Technical Implementation
- Frontend: Complete schema management UI with Material-UI components
- State Management: React Context + React Query for optimistic updates
- API Integration: Full CRUD operations for schemas and fields
- Validation: Real-time form validation with yup schemas
- Audit Trail: Backend audit logging for all schema changes

### Key Files Created
- Frontend: `src/components/schema-management/` (SchemaList, SchemaEditor, FieldCreationDialog, etc.)
- Backend: Schema audit endpoints, field validation services

## Epic 5: Development Environment Orchestration
**Completed**: September 2025
**Business Value**: Unified process management eliminating orphaned Node.js processes and inconsistent environment states

### Problem Solved
Hybrid development mode created process sprawl where Docker containers and native Node.js processes operated independently. Frontend continued running after `docker-compose down`, requiring manual process hunting (`lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9`).

### Stories Completed
- **5.1**: Immediate Process Management Solution - Unified start/stop/cleanup commands
- **5.2**: Complete Docker Containerization Strategy - Full Docker Compose orchestration
- **5.3**: Process Manager Orchestration Alternative - PM2 integration for process management
- **5.4**: Make-Based Development Commands - Makefile with `make start`, `make stop`, `make clean`, `make status`
- **5.5**: Advanced Development Monitoring - Real-time monitoring with Flower (Celery task monitor)

### Technical Implementation
- **Makefile**: Unified command interface (`make start`, `make stop`, `make clean`, `make status`)
- **Scripts**: `scripts/cleanup-utilities.sh`, `scripts/status-monitoring.sh`, `scripts/verify-monitoring.sh`
- **Docker Compose**: Complete orchestration with dependency management
- **PM2**: Alternative process manager configuration
- **Monitoring**: Celery Flower integration at http://localhost:5555

### Key Files Created
- `Makefile` - Unified development commands
- `scripts/cleanup-utilities.sh` - Orphaned process cleanup
- `scripts/status-monitoring.sh` - Environment health checks
- `scripts/verify-monitoring.sh` - Monitoring stack validation
- `docker-compose.yml` - Enhanced with process management

## Epic 6: Component Data Management
**Completed**: October 2025
**Business Value**: Engineers can add, edit, and delete component dimensions and specifications through UI, eliminating manual database updates

### Problem Solved
ComponentDimensions and ComponentSpecifications display components showed data in tables but had TODO placeholders for add/edit/delete operations. Engineers could view dimension/specification data but couldn't modify it through UI, requiring manual database updates or API calls.

### Stories Completed
- **6.1**: Component Dimension and Specification Management UI - Full CRUD dialogs for dimensions and specifications
- **6.1-fix**: Drawings List Display Bug Fix - Fixed component count display issue (showed "0" despite 71 components)
- **6.2**: Integrate Dimension/Spec Dialogs with UI - Wired up dialogs to ComponentDimensions/ComponentSpecifications components

### Technical Implementation
- **Backend**: Full CRUD API endpoints already existed (brownfield story)
- **Frontend**: Created DimensionDialog and SpecificationDialog components
- **Integration**: Wired dialogs into existing ComponentDimensions/ComponentSpecifications tables
- **Validation**: react-hook-form + yup validation for dimension/spec data
- **Fractional Input**: Support for fractional dimensions (e.g., "10 1/2 inches")

### Key Files Created/Modified
- `frontend/src/components/editor/DimensionDialog.tsx` - Dimension CRUD dialog
- `frontend/src/components/editor/SpecificationDialog.tsx` - Specification CRUD dialog
- `frontend/src/components/editor/ComponentDimensions.tsx` - Integrated dimension dialogs
- `frontend/src/components/editor/ComponentSpecifications.tsx` - Integrated spec dialogs
- `frontend/src/components/drawing/FlexibleComponentCard.tsx` - Fixed API integration bugs

## Epic 7: Data Export & Reporting
**Completed**: October 2025
**Business Value**: Engineers can export component data to CSV/Excel for analysis, share reports with stakeholders, and integrate with existing workflows

### Problem Solved
No export functionality existed. Engineers needed to manually copy data from UI or query database directly. Export system enables CSV/Excel export with customizable field selection and proper component-centric data model.

### Stories Completed
- **7.1**: Data Export - CSV Functionality - Initial implementation (drawing-centric, later corrected)
- **7.1.1**: CSV Export Component-Centric Refactor - Corrected data model to component-centric (each row = 1 component)
- **7.2**: Dedicated Export Page and API - Standalone export page at `/export` with enhanced UI
- **7.3**: Export Dynamic Schema Fields - Support for flexible schema fields in exports
- **7.3-implementation**: Implementation Summary - Consolidated export architecture documentation

**Critical Correction**: Story 7.1 initially implemented drawing-centric export (each row = 1 drawing with aggregated component data). Story 7.1.1 refactored to component-centric model (each row = 1 component with drawing context), which matches application's core purpose of component data indexing.

### Technical Implementation
- **Component-Centric Model**: Each CSV row represents one component with parent drawing context
- **Field Selection**: Accordion-based field selection UI with group checkboxes
- **Dynamic Schema**: Support for flexible component schema fields in export
- **Preview**: Real-time CSV preview before download
- **Backend**: Export API endpoints with efficient query optimization
- **Frontend**: Standalone export page (note: Navigation links to `/export` but page implementation minimal)

### Key Files Created
- Backend: `api/export.py`, `services/export_service.py`
- Frontend: `pages/ExportPage.tsx`, `components/ExportDialog.tsx`

## Epic 8: Project Management & Organization
**Completed**: October 2025
**Business Value**: Engineers can organize drawings by project, support multi-project assignments, and track unassigned drawings

### Problem Solved
No way to associate drawings with projects. Projects existed in isolation without drawing associations. Engineers couldn't group drawings by bridge project, filter by project, or track unassigned drawings. Also fixed critical bug where component counts showed "0" despite actual components existing.

### Stories Completed
- **8.1**: Project-Drawing Association Management - Overall epic coordination
- **8.1a**: Backend Foundation Bug Fix - Fixed component count calculation (eagerly load relationships)
- **8.1b**: Project Association UI - Many-to-many project-drawing associations with bulk operations

### Technical Implementation
- **Many-to-Many**: `project_drawings` junction table for flexible associations
- **Component Count Fix**: Eagerly load component relationships to fix "0" count display bug
- **UI**: Project selector on upload, bulk assignment UI, project filter on drawings list
- **API**: Endpoints for assigning/removing project associations
- **Flexibility**: Drawings can belong to multiple projects, support unassigned drawings

### Key Files Modified
- Backend: `models/database.py` (project_drawings table), `api/drawings.py` (association endpoints)
- Frontend: `pages/DrawingsListPage.tsx` (project filters), `components/UploadDrawingDialog.tsx` (project selection)

## Epic 9: Search & Discovery UX Improvements
**Completed**: October 2025
**Business Value**: Excel-like search results with sortable columns, confidence score visibility, and in-column filtering

### Problem Solved
Search results displayed in static table with separate filter controls. Confidence scores (ML/OCR quality metrics) existed in backend but weren't shown to users. Engineers accustomed to Excel-like data tables expected in-column filtering and sorting.

### Stories Completed
- **9.1**: Search UI Refactoring - Column-Based Filtering & Confidence Display - Added sortable columns, confidence score display
- **9.2**: Search UI Refinement - Enhanced column filtering, improved UX based on feedback

### Technical Implementation
- **Confidence Display**: Added "Confidence" column showing ML/OCR quality scores
- **Column Sorting**: Interactive table headers with sort controls
- **In-Column Filtering**: Filter dropdowns embedded in column headers (Excel-like UX)
- **Backend Verification**: Confidence filtering already supported by API, single-select filters implemented

### Key Files Modified
- Frontend: `pages/SearchPage.tsx` - Refactored search results table with sortable/filterable columns
- UI Pattern: Material-UI table headers with embedded filter controls

## Archive Deleted: October 2025
**Previous Location**: `docs/stories-archive/` (49 files, ~1MB)
**Rationale**: Git already tracks all story history perfectly. Archiving created duplicate documentation, fragmented search, and required manual maintenance.

**To view historical story content**:
```bash
# Find when a story was worked on
git log --all --grep="Story 7.3" --oneline

# View story file at specific time
git log --all --full-history -- "*story-7.3*"
git show <commit>:docs/stories/story-7.3-export-dynamic-schema-fields.md

# View all changes to a story
git log -p -- "*story-7.3*"

# Tag completed stories (optional)
git tag story-7.3-complete <commit-hash>
git tag -l "story-*"
```

## Story Numbering Convention

Stories are numbered within epic namespaces (e.g., Epic 3 = 3.x stories). Story numbers increment forever within an epic - never restart or reuse numbers.

**Example**: Epic 3 stories go 3.1 → 3.2 → 3.3 → ... → 3.16 → **3.17** (next story)

Completing stories doesn't reset the counter. If Epic 3's highest story is 3.16, your next Epic 3 story should be 3.17, regardless of when previous stories were completed.
