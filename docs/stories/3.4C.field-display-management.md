# Story 3.4C: Field Display Management

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** railroad bridge engineer,
**I want** to organize and control how fields appear in component creation forms,
**so that** the data entry workflow is logical and efficient for my engineering team.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Field Reordering Interface**
   - Drag-and-drop interface for changing field display order
   - Visual feedback during drag operations with drop zones
   - Automatic save of new field order
   - Keyboard accessibility for reordering (arrow keys, tab navigation)
   - Undo/redo capability for ordering changes

2. **Field Grouping System**
   - Create field groups (e.g., "Dimensions", "Material Properties", "Notes")
   - Assign fields to groups via drag-and-drop or selection interface
   - Group header customization with titles and descriptions
   - Collapsible group sections in component forms
   - Group reordering capability (groups and fields within groups)

3. **Display Properties Configuration**
   - Field width settings (full width, half width, quarter width)
   - Field alignment within rows (left, center, right)
   - Conditional field display rules (show/hide based on other field values)
   - Field spacing and padding configuration
   - Mobile vs desktop display differences

4. **Field Layout Preview**
   - Real-time preview of how fields will appear in component creation forms
   - Preview toggle between mobile and desktop layouts
   - Sample data population in preview for accurate visualization
   - Preview updates immediately when display properties change
   - Full-screen preview mode for detailed review

5. **Layout Templates**
   - Pre-defined layout templates for common engineering component types
   - Templates: "Basic Component", "Structural Element", "Connection Detail"
   - Template application with field mapping assistance
   - Save custom layouts as reusable templates
   - Template sharing between projects

6. **Field Visibility Management**
   - Show/hide fields without deleting them
   - Conditional visibility rules based on user roles or project types
   - Field visibility preview in different contexts
   - Bulk field visibility operations
   - Visibility rule testing interface

7. **Form Flow Optimization**
   - Tab/section organization for complex schemas with many fields
   - Logical flow validation (required fields early, optional fields later)
   - Field dependency visualization (arrows showing relationships)
   - Form completion guidance (progress indicators, required field highlighting)
   - User experience testing suggestions

8. **Responsive Design Configuration**
   - Mobile layout configuration with field stacking rules
   - Tablet layout optimization
   - Field priority for small screen display
   - Touch-friendly spacing and sizing for mobile devices
   - Cross-device layout consistency validation

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
**Source:** [docs/architecture.md] - Component-based React architecture with responsive design and accessibility compliance requirements.

**Dependency:** This story completes the field management functionality from Stories 3.4A (Core Field Management) and 3.4B (Advanced Field Configuration) by adding display and organization capabilities.

### Component Integration Requirements
**Integration with Previous Stories:**
- Story 3.4A: Field list interface integration for reordering
- Story 3.4B: Advanced configuration affects display options
- Story 3.3: Preview integration with schema editing workflow

### Display Management Data Model
**Display Configuration Structure:**
```typescript
interface FieldDisplayConfig {
  field_id: string;
  display_order: number;
  group_id?: string;
  width: 'full' | 'half' | 'quarter';
  alignment: 'left' | 'center' | 'right';
  is_visible: boolean;
  visibility_rules?: ConditionalRule[];
  mobile_config?: MobileDisplayConfig;
}

interface FieldGroup {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  display_order: number;
  is_collapsible: boolean;
  default_collapsed: boolean;
}
```

### Drag-and-Drop Implementation
**Library Choice:** [docs/architecture.md#tech-stack] - Build on standard libraries, minimize custom components. Use react-beautiful-dnd or @dnd-kit for drag-and-drop functionality.

**Accessibility Requirements:** [docs/front-end-spec.md] - Keyboard navigation support for drag-and-drop operations, screen reader compatibility.

### Responsive Design Strategy
**Source:** [docs/front-end-spec.md] - Mobile responsive design requirements with touch-friendly interfaces.

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
- Mobile: < 768px (single column, stacked fields)
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px (two-column layout)
- Desktop: > 1024px (flexible multi-column layout)

### Preview System Architecture
**Real-time Preview Requirements:**
- Preview updates immediately when configuration changes
- Sample data generation for accurate field rendering
- Component form rendering that matches actual implementation
- Performance optimization for complex schemas

### Layout Template System
**Template Storage and Management:**
- Templates stored as JSON configuration objects
- Template categories based on engineering component types
- Template versioning for updates and compatibility
- Template sharing mechanism between projects

### API Integration Requirements
**Expected API Endpoints:**
- `updateFieldDisplayOrder(schemaId, fieldOrders)` - Save field reordering
- `createFieldGroup(schemaId, groupData)` - Create field group
- `updateFieldDisplayConfig(fieldId, displayConfig)` - Update display configuration
- `saveLayoutTemplate(templateData)` - Save layout template
- `getLayoutTemplates(category)` - Retrieve available templates

### Performance Considerations
**Display Management Performance:**
- Efficient re-rendering during drag operations
- Debounced save operations for frequent changes
- Virtual scrolling for large field lists
- Optimized preview rendering for complex layouts

### Testing

**Testing Standards:** [docs/architecture.md#tech-stack] - React Testing Library with emphasis on drag-and-drop interactions and responsive design testing.

**Testing Requirements for this Story:**
- Drag-and-drop functionality testing with keyboard and mouse
- Responsive layout testing across different screen sizes
- Field grouping and organization testing
- Preview accuracy testing with various field configurations
- Accessibility testing for complex interactions

**Test File Locations:**
- `src/components/schema-management/FieldReorderInterface.test.tsx`
- `src/components/schema-management/FieldGroupManager.test.tsx`
- `src/components/schema-management/LayoutPreview.test.tsx`
- `src/components/schema-management/ResponsiveLayoutConfig.test.tsx`
