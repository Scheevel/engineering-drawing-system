# Story 3.5: Advanced Field Operations

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** railroad bridge engineer,
**I want** to perform bulk operations and advanced management tasks on schema fields,
**so that** I can efficiently manage complex schemas and maintain consistency across projects.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Bulk Field Selection System**
   - Multi-select interface for field operations (checkboxes or click-to-select)
   - Select all/none functionality with clear visual indicators
   - Filtered selection (select all visible, select by type, select by group)
   - Selection persistence during scroll and pagination
   - Clear selection count and selected field indicators

2. **Bulk Field Operations Interface**
   - Bulk delete with confirmation dialog showing impact analysis
   - Bulk activation/deactivation of selected fields
   - Bulk field type changes (where compatible)
   - Bulk property updates (required status, help text, group assignment)
   - Operation preview before execution with rollback capability

3. **Field Duplication System**
   - Duplicate individual fields with configuration cloning
   - Duplicate field groups with all contained fields
   - Smart naming for duplicated fields (append "_copy", increment numbers)
   - Duplicate across schemas within same project
   - Bulk duplication of selected fields

4. **Field Import/Export Functionality**
   - Export field definitions to JSON format for backup/sharing
   - Import field definitions from JSON with validation
   - Export entire schema field structure
   - Import fields from other schemas with conflict resolution
   - Template export/import for reusable field sets

5. **Field Search and Filtering**
   - Search fields by name, type, or configuration properties
   - Filter by field type, required status, group assignment, active status
   - Advanced search with multiple criteria combinations
   - Search highlighting in field list with jump-to functionality
   - Saved search filters for common operations

6. **Field Migration Tools**
   - Migrate fields between schemas with data mapping assistance
   - Field type conversion with data preservation warnings
   - Schema merge functionality for combining field sets
   - Field conflict resolution during merge operations
   - Migration preview with impact analysis

7. **Field Validation and Cleanup**
   - Validate field configurations for completeness and correctness
   - Identify orphaned or unused fields across projects
   - Find duplicate or similar field configurations
   - Cleanup wizard for removing redundant field configurations
   - Validation report generation with recommended actions

8. **Advanced Field Analytics**
   - Field usage statistics across components and projects
   - Field performance metrics (validation speed, error rates)
   - Field configuration complexity analysis
   - Recommendations for field optimization
   - Export analytics data for external analysis

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
**Source:** [docs/architecture.md] - Component-based architecture with React Query for optimistic updates and conflict resolution. Background processing patterns for complex operations.

**Dependency:** This story builds on Stories 3.4A, 3.4B, and 3.4C providing advanced operations for the field management system established in those stories.

### Bulk Operations Architecture
**Operation Strategy:**
- Optimistic updates for simple bulk operations
- Background processing for complex operations (migration, analysis)
- Operation queuing system for handling multiple concurrent operations
- Progress tracking and cancellation capabilities

**State Management:**
- Selection state managed in React Context
- Operation history for undo/redo functionality
- Conflict resolution state for import/merge operations

### Import/Export Data Format
**Field Export Schema:**
```typescript
interface FieldExportData {
  version: string;
  schema_metadata: {
    name: string;
    description?: string;
    export_date: string;
  };
  fields: ComponentSchemaField[];
  groups: FieldGroup[];
  validation_rules: ValidationRule[];
}
```

### Performance Considerations
**Large Schema Handling:**
- Virtual scrolling for large field lists during bulk operations
- Debounced search and filtering
- Lazy loading of field analytics data
- Progressive operation execution for bulk operations

### API Integration Requirements
**Expected API Endpoints:**
- `bulkUpdateFields(operations)` - Execute bulk field operations
- `duplicateFields(fieldIds, targetSchema)` - Duplicate fields
- `exportFields(schemaId, options)` - Export field definitions
- `importFields(schemaId, data, options)` - Import field definitions
- `migrateFields(sourceSchema, targetSchema, mapping)` - Migrate fields
- `validateFields(schemaId)` - Validate field configurations
- `getFieldAnalytics(schemaId)` - Get field usage analytics

### Business Logic Rules
**Bulk Operation Rules:**
- Cannot delete fields currently in use by components
- Type changes must be compatible with existing data
- Required field status changes need validation
- Operations affecting default schema require special handling

### Search and Filtering Features
**Search Capabilities:**
- Full-text search across field names and descriptions
- Property-based search (type, required status, etc.)
- Regular expression support for advanced users
- Search result highlighting and navigation

### Migration and Conflict Resolution
**Conflict Types:**
- Field name conflicts during import/migration
- Field type incompatibilities
- Validation rule conflicts
- Group assignment conflicts

**Resolution Strategies:**
- Rename conflicting fields automatically
- Provide manual conflict resolution interface
- Preview mode for all migration operations
- Rollback capability for failed operations

### Testing

**Testing Standards:** [docs/architecture.md#tech-stack] - Jest + React Testing Library with emphasis on complex user interactions and data operations.

**Testing Requirements for this Story:**
- Bulk operation testing with various field selections
- Import/export functionality testing with valid/invalid data
- Search and filtering testing with different criteria
- Migration testing with conflict scenarios
- Performance testing with large schemas (50+ fields)

**Test File Locations:**
- `src/components/schema-management/BulkFieldSelector.test.tsx`
- `src/components/schema-management/FieldImportExport.test.tsx`
- `src/hooks/schema/useFieldSearch.test.ts`
- `src/services/fieldAnalyticsService.test.ts`
