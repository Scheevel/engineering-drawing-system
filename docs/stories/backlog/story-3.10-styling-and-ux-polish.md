## Technical Implementation

### Styling Infrastructure

**Enhanced Theme Configuration:**
```typescript
// Enhanced theme with schema-specific customizations
const schemaTheme = createTheme({
  ...baseTheme,
  components: {
    MuiCard: {
      styleOverrides: {
        root: {
          '&.schema-card': {
            transition: 'all 0.2s ease-in-out',
            '&:hover': {
              boxShadow: theme.shadows[4],
              transform: 'translateY(-1px)',
            },
            '&.schema-default': {
              borderLeft: `4px solid ${theme.palette.primary.main}`,
              backgroundColor: alpha(theme.palette.primary.main, 0.02),
            },
            '&.schema-editing': {
              borderLeft: `4px solid ${theme.palette.success.main}`,
              backgroundColor: alpha(theme.palette.success.main, 0.02),
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
    MuiButton: {
      styleOverrides: {
        root: {
          '&.schema-action': {
            transition: 'all 0.15s ease-in-out',
            '&:hover': {
              transform: 'translateY(-1px)',
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

**Animation Utilities:**
```typescript
// Reusable animation constants and utilities
export const animations = {
  durations: {
    fast: 150,
    standard: 300,
    slow: 500,
  },
  easings: {
    easeInOut: 'cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)',
    easeOut: 'cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.2, 1)',
    easeIn: 'cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 1, 1)',
  },
  transitions: {
    fadeIn: {
      opacity: 0,
      animation: 'fadeIn 0.3s ease-in-out forwards',
    },
    slideUp: {
      transform: 'translateY(20px)',
      opacity: 0,
      animation: 'slideUp 0.3s ease-out forwards',
    },
  },
};

// Animation keyframes
const globalStyles = css`
  @keyframes fadeIn {
    to { opacity: 1; }
  }

  @keyframes slideUp {
    to {
      transform: translateY(0);
      opacity: 1;
    }
  }

  @keyframes gentleShake {
    0%, 100% { transform: translateX(0); }
    25% { transform: translateX(-2px); }
    75% { transform: translateX(2px); }
  }
`;
```

### Component Enhancements

  reduceMotion: () => window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches,

  announceToScreenReader: (message: string) => {
    const announcement = document.createElement('div');
    announcement.setAttribute('aria-live', 'polite');
    announcement.setAttribute('aria-atomic', 'true');
    announcement.className = 'sr-only';
    announcement.textContent = message;
    document.body.appendChild(announcement);
    setTimeout(() => document.body.removeChild(announcement), 1000);
  },

  getFocusableElements: (container: HTMLElement) => {
    return container.querySelectorAll(
      'button, [href], input, select, textarea, [tabindex]:not([tabindex="-1"])'
    );
  },
};
```

## Dev Notes

### Existing Codebase Context

**Current Theme Setup:**
- Material-UI theme configuration located in `frontend/src/App.tsx`
- Base theme uses Material-UI createTheme with custom palette and typography
- Dark mode support infrastructure exists but may need schema-specific enhancements
- Theme provider wraps entire application providing consistent design tokens

**Schema Management Component Locations:**
- Core schema components: `frontend/src/components/schema-management/`
- Form components: `frontend/src/components/schema-forms/`
- Flexible components: `frontend/src/components/flexible/`
- Key files requiring styling enhancement:
  - `SchemaManagementCard.tsx` - Primary component needing visual state styling
  - `FieldReorderInterface.tsx` - Drag-and-drop animations needed
  - `SchemaListView.tsx` - Loading states and transitions
  - `SchemaCreateDialog.tsx` - Modal animation enhancement

**Existing Animation Infrastructure:**
- Material-UI transition components available (Fade, Slide, Grow, Collapse)
- React Transition Group may be available for complex animation sequences
- CSS-in-JS styling approach using Material-UI's sx prop and styled components
- Performance optimization needed for animations in components with 50+ fields

### Implementation Architecture

**Theme Enhancement Strategy:**
```typescript
// Extend existing theme in App.tsx or create new theme file
const enhancedTheme = createTheme({
  ...existingTheme,
  components: {
    ...existingTheme.components,
    // Add schema-specific component overrides
    MuiCard: {
      styleOverrides: {
        root: ({ theme, ownerState }) => ({
          // Schema-specific styling based on state
        }),
      },
    },
  },
  // Add schema-specific design tokens
  palette: {
    ...existingTheme.palette,
    schema: {
      default: theme.palette.primary.main,
      active: theme.palette.success.main,
      editing: theme.palette.warning.main,
    },
  },
});
```

**Animation Utilities Location:**
- Create `frontend/src/utils/animations.ts` for reusable animation constants
- Implement prefers-reduced-motion detection utilities
- Use Material-UI's useTheme hook for consistent timing and easing values
- Consider React Spring for complex drag-and-drop animations

**Component Enhancement Pattern:**
```typescript
// Example enhancement for existing components
const EnhancedSchemaCard = styled(Card, {
  shouldForwardProp: (prop) => prop !== 'schemaState',
})<{ schemaState: 'default' | 'active' | 'editing' }>(
  ({ theme, schemaState }) => ({
    transition: theme.transitions.create(['transform', 'box-shadow'], {
      duration: theme.transitions.duration.standard,
    }),
    '&:hover': {
      transform: 'translateY(-1px)',
      boxShadow: theme.shadows[4],
    },
    // State-specific styling
  })
);
```

### Integration Points

**State Management Integration:**
- Schema state managed through React Query in `frontend/src/services/schemaQueries.ts`
- Loading states available through React Query's isLoading, isFetching flags
- Error states accessible through React Query's error property
- Optimistic updates may require animation coordination

**Event System Integration:**
- SchemaEventBus in `frontend/src/contexts/SchemaEventBus.tsx` for cross-component communication
- Field reorder events need animation coordination
- Validation events should trigger smooth UI state transitions
- Success/error notifications integrate with existing toast system

**Accessibility Integration:**
- Existing accessibility utilities may be in `frontend/src/utils/`
- WCAG compliance testing should integrate with existing Jest/React Testing Library setup
- Screen reader announcements coordinate with existing ARIA patterns
- Keyboard navigation builds on existing Material-UI component accessibility

### Performance Considerations

**Animation Performance:**
- Use CSS transforms (translateX, translateY, scale) instead of changing layout properties
- Implement will-change CSS property judiciously for animating elements
- Use React.memo for components with expensive re-renders during animations
- Consider React.useCallback for event handlers in frequently re-rendering components

**Bundle Size Optimization:**
- Lazy load complex animation utilities if not immediately needed
- Tree-shake unused Material-UI components and icons
- Consider dynamic imports for advanced animation libraries (React Spring)
- Monitor bundle impact of additional styling utilities

**Memory Management:**
- Clean up animation event listeners and timeouts in useEffect cleanup
- Use AbortController for animations that may be interrupted
- Implement proper cleanup for drag-and-drop event handlers
- Monitor memory usage during extended animation sequences

### Testing Integration

**Existing Test Infrastructure:**
- React Testing Library setup in `frontend/src/test-utils/`
- Jest configuration supports CSS-in-JS and component testing
- Mock utilities available for API responses and React Query
- Accessibility testing with @testing-library/jest-dom matchers

**Animation Testing Approach:**
- Mock timers for animation testing with Jest's fake timers
- Test animation classes application rather than timing-dependent assertions
- Use React Testing Library's waitFor for animation completion
- Mock prefers-reduced-motion for accessibility testing

**Visual Regression Setup:**
- Consider integration with existing Storybook setup if available
- Chromatic or similar tool for visual diff testing
- Component snapshot testing for different states and themes
- Cross-browser testing automation for animation consistency
