## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
**Source:** [docs/architecture.md] - UI Component Library: Material-UI (MUI) ^5.14.0 for professional engineering UI components with consistent design system.

**Dependency:** This story completes Epic 3 by adding final polish to all schema management functionality implemented in Stories 3.1-3.9.

### Material-UI Theme Enhancement
**Source:** [docs/front-end-spec.md] - Build on standard libraries, minimize custom components. Use Material-UI design system patterns.

**Theme Structure:**
```typescript
const schemaTheme = createTheme({
  ...baseTheme,
  components: {
    MuiCard: {
      styleOverrides: {
        root: {
          '&.schema-card': {
            transition: 'all 0.2s ease-in-out',
            '&.schema-default': {
              borderLeft: `4px solid ${theme.palette.primary.main}`,
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Responsive Design Strategy
**Source:** [docs/front-end-spec.md] - Mobile responsive design requirements with touch-friendly interfaces.

**Breakpoints:**
- Mobile: < 768px (single column, stacked elements)
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px (two-column layout)
- Desktop: > 1024px (multi-column, full feature set)

### Animation System Architecture
**Animation Guidelines:**
- Fast animations: 150ms for immediate feedback
- Standard animations: 300ms for state transitions
- Slow animations: 500ms for complex transitions
- Easing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) for natural feel

**Performance Requirements:**
- Maintain 60fps during all animations
- Use GPU-accelerated CSS transforms
- Avoid layout thrashing with transform/opacity animations
- Implement animation cancellation for interrupted interactions

### Accessibility Implementation
**Source:** [docs/front-end-spec.md] - Accessibility requirements for engineering interfaces.

**WCAG 2.1 AA Requirements:**
- Color contrast ratios ≥ 4.5:1 for normal text
- Color contrast ratios ≥ 3:1 for large text and UI components
- Touch targets ≥ 44px minimum size
- Text resizable to 200% without horizontal scrolling
- Keyboard accessible with logical tab order

### Loading State Strategy
**Loading Animation Types:**
- Skeleton screens that match content structure
- Spinner overlays for button actions
- Progress bars for multi-step operations
- Shimmer effects for data loading
- Non-blocking indicators for background operations

### Interactive Feedback System
**Hover Timing Standards:**
- Immediate feedback (0ms): button state changes
- Short delay (150ms): tooltip appearance
- Medium delay (300ms): preview content loading
- Long delay (500ms): complex hover interactions

### Performance Optimization Strategy
**Rendering Performance:**
- React.memo for expensive components
- useMemo for complex calculations
- useCallback for stable references
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Debounced user interactions

### Cross-Browser Compatibility
**Browser Support:**
- Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Edge (latest 2 versions)

### Visual Design System
**Color Coding System:**
- Primary blue: Active/selected schemas
- Success green: Saved/completed states
- Warning orange: Validation warnings
- Error red: Critical errors
- Neutral gray: Inactive/disabled states

### Asset Optimization
**Performance Considerations:**
- Optimized icon fonts or SVG sprites
- Efficient image loading and caching
- Minimal bundle size impact
- Lazy loading for non-critical visual elements

### Integration with Existing Styles
**Source:** Current application analysis - Must maintain consistency with existing Material-UI theme and component styling.

**Integration Points:**
- Navigation component styling consistency
- Form component styling alignment
- Modal and dialog styling inheritance
- Button and action styling uniformity

### Testing

**Testing Standards:** [docs/architecture.md#tech-stack] - Visual regression testing and accessibility compliance validation.

**Testing Requirements for this Story:**
- Visual regression testing with snapshot comparisons
- Accessibility compliance testing with axe-core
- Animation performance testing across devices
- Responsive design testing on multiple screen sizes
- Cross-browser compatibility validation
- Touch interaction testing on mobile devices

**Test File Locations:**
- `src/styles/schemaTheme.test.ts`
- `src/utils/animations.test.ts`
- Visual regression tests integrated with existing testing framework
- Accessibility tests for all enhanced components
