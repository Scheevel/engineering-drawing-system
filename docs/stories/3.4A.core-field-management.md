# Story 3.4A: Core Field Management

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** railroad bridge engineer,
**I want** to add, edit, and remove individual fields within my component schemas,
**so that** I can define the basic data structure for my engineering components.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Field List Display Interface**
   - Display existing schema fields in organized, editable list format
   - Show field name, type, required status, and basic configuration summary
   - Visual distinction between required and optional fields
   - Field status indicators (active/inactive)
   - Loading states for individual field operations

2. **Add New Field Functionality**
   - Prominent "Add Field" button accessible from schema editing interface
   - Opens field creation form/dialog with clear field requirements
   - Required fields: field name, field type
   - Optional fields: help text, required status
   - Real-time validation of field name uniqueness within schema

3. **Basic Field Type Support**
   - Field type selector with core types: text, number, select, checkbox, textarea, date
   - Clear descriptions and examples for each field type
   - Icons or visual indicators for field types
   - Type selection triggers appropriate basic configuration options

4. **Field Editing Interface**
   - In-line editing or modal dialog for modifying existing fields
   - Edit field name, type, required status, and help text
   - Prevent editing of fields currently in use by components (show warning)
   - Save/cancel functionality with confirmation dialogs

5. **Remove Field Functionality**
   - Delete button for each field with confirmation dialog
   - Prevent deletion of fields currently in use by components
   - Clear warning messages about impact of field removal
   - Soft delete vs hard delete based on usage

6. **Field Activation Toggle**
   - Toggle to activate/deactivate fields without deletion
   - Visual indication of inactive fields (grayed out, different styling)
   - Preserve field configuration when deactivating
   - Bulk activation/deactivation capability preparation

7. **Basic Field Validation**
   - Real-time validation of field configuration during editing
   - Prevent duplicate field names within schema
   - Validate required field configurations for each type
   - Clear error messaging with correction suggestions

8. **Help Text Management**
   - Help text configuration for each field with character limits
   - Preview of help text as it will appear to users
   - Support for basic formatting (line breaks, basic markdown)

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
**Source:** [docs/architecture.md] - Component-based architecture with React Hook Form for form state management. Multi-stage validation with business rules and data integrity checks.

**Field Management Complexity:** This story focuses on core CRUD operations for fields, while advanced field configuration and display management are handled in Stories 3.4B and 3.4C respectively.

### Component Integration
**Source:** Stories 3.2, 3.3 - Field management integrates with SchemaManagementCard edit mode and must work within the schema editing workflow established in previous stories.

**Integration Points:**
- Schema editing interface from Story 3.3
- Field list display within schema management interface
- Form state management coordination with schema-level editing

### Field Type System
**Core Field Types (Basic Implementation):**
- `text`: Single-line text input with basic validation
- `number`: Numeric input with basic min/max validation
- `select`: Dropdown selection with option management
- `checkbox`: Boolean true/false selection
- `textarea`: Multi-line text input
- `date`: Date picker input

**Advanced Configuration:** Complex field type configurations (patterns, complex validation, etc.) are handled in Story 3.4B.

### Data Model Requirements
**Field Interface Structure:**
```typescript
interface ComponentSchemaField {
  id: string;
  field_name: string;
  field_type: FieldType;
  field_config: Record<string, any>; // Basic config only
  help_text?: string;
  is_required: boolean;
  is_active: boolean;
  display_order: number; // Basic ordering, advanced in 3.4C
}
```

### API Integration Requirements
**Expected API Endpoints:**
- `addSchemaField(schemaId, fieldData)` - Add new field to schema
- `updateSchemaField(fieldId, updates)` - Update field configuration
- `removeSchemaField(fieldId)` - Remove field from schema
- `toggleFieldActive(fieldId)` - Activate/deactivate field
- `validateFieldName(schemaId, fieldName)` - Check field name uniqueness

### Business Logic Rules
**Field Management Rules:**
- Field names must be unique within schema
- Required fields cannot be removed if components use them
- Field types can be changed if no data conflicts exist
- Inactive fields are hidden from component forms but preserved in schema

### State Management Strategy
**React Query Integration:**
- Optimistic updates for field operations
- Cache invalidation for schema data on field changes
- Error rollback for failed field operations
- Loading states for individual field operations

### Testing

**Testing Standards:** [docs/architecture.md#tech-stack] - Jest + React Testing Library with component and integration testing patterns.

**Testing Requirements for this Story:**
- Field CRUD operation testing with mock API responses
- Field validation testing with various input scenarios
- Component integration testing with schema editing workflow
- Error handling testing for API failures
- Accessibility testing for field management interface

**Test File Locations:**
- `src/components/schema-management/SchemaFieldList.test.tsx`
- `src/components/schema-management/FieldCreationDialog.test.tsx`
- `src/components/schema-management/FieldTypeSelector.test.tsx`
- `src/hooks/schema/useFieldCRUD.test.ts`
