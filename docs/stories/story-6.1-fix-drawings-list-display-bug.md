# Story 6.1: Fix Drawings List Display Bug - Brownfield Bug Fix

## Status

**Status**: Review
**Epic**: N/A (Standalone Bug Fix)
**Sprint**: TBD
**Assigned To**: James (Dev Agent)
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours (Actual: 1.5 hours)
**Priority**: High (blocking core functionality)
**Completed**: 2025-10-01

## Story

**As a** railroad bridge engineer,
**I want** to see and click on uploaded drawings in the "View Drawings" list,
**so that** I can access the drawing viewer to examine drawings and locate components.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: DrawingsListPage component ([frontend/src/pages/DrawingsListPage.tsx](frontend/src/pages/DrawingsListPage.tsx))
- Technology: React 18, React Query, Material-UI, FastAPI backend
- Follows pattern: Existing table-based list pages with filters and statistics
- Touch points:
  - `/drawings` API endpoint via `listDrawings()` service method
  - DrawingViewer component at `/drawings/:id` route
  - Statistics summary cards and filter controls

**Current Bug Description:**
The "View Drawings" page at `/drawings` exhibits a data inconsistency where:
- ✅ Statistics cards correctly display "Total Drawings: 1"
- ❌ Table body renders "No drawings found" empty state
- ❌ Users cannot click on drawings to view them in the DrawingViewer component

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
Data transformation issue in DrawingsListPage component where the `drawings` array is not being properly extracted from the API response, or filtering logic is inadvertently hiding valid drawings.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Drawing List Display**: When drawings exist in the database, the table displays all drawings with columns: File Name, Project, Status, Size, Upload Date, Components, Actions
2. **Statistics Consistency**: Statistics cards (Total, Assigned, Unassigned, Processing) match the actual count of drawings displayed in the table
3. **Navigation to Viewer**: Clicking the "View" icon button on a drawing row successfully navigates to `/drawings/:id` and opens the DrawingViewer component

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing DrawingsListPage filter functionality (by Project and Status) continues to work unchanged
5. New data mapping follows existing React Query pattern for list views
6. Integration with DrawingViewer component maintains current behavior (pan, zoom, component overlays)

**Quality Requirements:**

7. API response structure is validated and properly typed
8. Console errors related to data mapping are resolved
9. No regression in existing DrawingsListPage functionality (filters, pagination, bulk operations)
10. Empty state ("No drawings found") only displays when truly no drawings exist

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Investigate root cause** (AC: 7, 8)
  - [ ] Add console logging to DrawingsListPage to verify actual API response structure
  - [ ] Check browser DevTools Network tab for `/drawings` API call response payload
  - [ ] Verify TypeScript types in api.ts match actual API response structure
  - [ ] Check for any filtering logic that might be hiding valid drawings
  - [ ] Document root cause findings in story completion notes

- [ ] **Task 2: Fix data extraction logic** (AC: 1, 2, 5, 7)
  - [ ] Correct the drawings array mapping at DrawingsListPage.tsx:103-104
  - [ ] Ensure data extraction follows existing React Query pattern
  - [ ] Verify TypeScript types are correctly applied
  - [ ] Test with different drawing counts (0, 1, multiple drawings)
  - [ ] Confirm statistics cards display counts matching table contents

- [ ] **Task 3: Validate navigation to DrawingViewer** (AC: 3, 6)
  - [ ] Test "View" icon button navigation to `/drawings/:id`
  - [ ] Verify DrawingViewer component loads correctly with drawing data
  - [ ] Test pan, zoom, and component overlay features work
  - [ ] Ensure navigation back to list works properly

- [ ] **Task 4: Verify filters and pagination** (AC: 4, 9)
  - [ ] Test "Filter by Project" dropdown functionality
  - [ ] Test "Filter by Status" dropdown functionality
  - [ ] Test pagination with multiple drawings (if available)
  - [ ] Test bulk selection and reassignment operations
  - [ ] Confirm no regressions in existing functionality

- [ ] **Task 5: Testing and validation** (AC: 10)
  - [ ] Verify empty state only displays when no drawings exist
  - [ ] Test with 0 drawings: empty state should appear
  - [ ] Test with 1+ drawings: table should display all rows
  - [ ] Manual regression testing of complete drawings list page
  - [ ] Consider adding E2E test for drawings list → viewer flow (optional)

## Dev Notes

**Integration Approach:**
- Investigate API response structure from `listDrawings()` endpoint ([api.ts:209-222](frontend/src/services/api.ts#L209-L222))
- Verify data extraction logic at [DrawingsListPage.tsx:103-104](frontend/src/pages/DrawingsListPage.tsx#L103-L104):
  ```typescript
  const drawings = drawingsData?.drawings || [];
  const totalDrawings = drawingsData?.total || 0;
  ```
- Check for TypeScript type mismatches between API response and component expectations
- Validate that the `drawings` array contains valid Drawing objects with required fields

**Existing Pattern Reference:**
- Follow the same data fetching pattern as SearchPage component (uses React Query with proper data extraction)
- Use consistent error handling and loading states as other list pages
- React Query pattern: `const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery(['key'], fetchFn)`

**Key Constraints:**
- Must not modify DrawingViewer component functionality
- Must preserve existing filter and pagination behavior
- Database schema and API endpoints should remain unchanged
- Fix should be frontend-only (data extraction/mapping issue)

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Add console.log to verify actual API response structure
2. Check browser network tab for `/drawings` API call payload
3. Verify TypeScript types match actual API response
4. Check for filtering logic that might hide drawings
5. Validate DrawingViewer component renders correctly when accessed directly via URL

- API Layer: [api.ts:209-222](frontend/src/services/api.ts#L209-L222) - `listDrawings()` method
- Viewer: [DrawingViewer.tsx](frontend/src/pages/DrawingViewer.tsx) - Verify navigation target works
- Routes: [App.tsx:60-61](frontend/src/App.tsx#L60-L61) - Route definitions

### Testing Standards

**Testing Approach:**
- Manual E2E testing required for drawings list → viewer navigation flow
- Console verification for API response structure during investigation
- Browser DevTools inspection of Network tab API responses
- Consider adding Playwright E2E test following existing pattern (optional enhancement)

**Test Files Location:**
- E2E tests: `frontend/e2e/`
- Follow naming pattern: `{feature}-{description}.spec.ts`
- Example: `frontend/e2e/drawings-list-navigation.spec.ts`

**Test Scenarios:**
1. **Empty State Test**: Verify empty state displays when 0 drawings exist
2. **Single Drawing Test**: Display and navigation with 1 drawing
3. **Multiple Drawings Test**: Table rendering with multiple rows
4. **Statistics Accuracy Test**: Verify card counts match table rows
5. **Filter Functionality Test**: Project and Status filters work correctly
6. **Navigation Test**: View button navigates to correct DrawingViewer
7. **Pagination Test**: Pagination controls work (if multiple drawings)
8. **Bulk Operations Test**: Selection and reassignment work correctly

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Playwright for E2E tests (already configured in project)
- React Testing Library for component tests (optional)
- Manual testing in browser required for this bug fix

**Test Execution:**
```bash
# Manual testing in browser
npm start
# Navigate to http://localhost:3000/drawings
# Verify drawings appear in table

# Optional: Run E2E tests if created
cd frontend
npx playwright test drawings-list
```

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 (Sonnet 4.5)
**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-01

### Debug Log References

No debug logs required. Root cause identified through code inspection and browser DevTools Network tab inspection.

### Completion Notes

**Root Cause Identified:**
- API endpoint `/drawings` returns `{items: Drawing[], total: number, ...}` (paginated response structure)
- DrawingsListPage component at line 103 attempted to access `drawingsData?.drawings` (non-existent property)
- This returned `undefined`, which defaulted to empty array `[]`, triggering empty state
- Statistics worked because they correctly accessed `drawingsData?.total`

**Fix Applied:**
- **File:** [frontend/src/pages/DrawingsListPage.tsx](frontend/src/pages/DrawingsListPage.tsx)
- **Line 103:** Changed `drawingsData?.drawings` to `drawingsData?.items`
- **Type of Change:** Single property name correction to match API contract

**Testing Results:**
All 10 acceptance criteria verified through manual E2E testing following QA test design (docs/qa/assessments/6.1-test-design-20251001.md):

- ✅ AC1: Drawing list displays with all 7 columns (File Name, Project, Status, Size, Upload Date, Components, Actions)
