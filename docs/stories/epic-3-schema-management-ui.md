# Epic 3: Schema Management UI Implementation

**Epic Overview:** Comprehensive frontend implementation for default type schema management functionality that integrates seamlessly with the existing Engineering Drawing Index System.

## Epic Goals

Enable users to create, edit, and manage component type schemas through an intuitive UI that:
- Integrates with existing flexible component architecture
- Provides real-time validation and preview capabilities
- Supports collaborative access (no admin permissions required)
- Maintains consistency with current Material-UI design patterns

## Architecture Foundation

Based on comprehensive frontend architecture analysis covering:
- React 18 + TypeScript + Material-UI stack integration
- State management with React Query + Context patterns
- API integration extending existing schema endpoints
- Responsive design and accessibility compliance

## Story Overview & Dependencies

```
Epic 3: Schema Management UI (69 Story Points, 8 weeks)
├── Story 3.1: Core Infrastructure Setup (3 SP)
├── Story 3.2: Basic Schema Management Components (5 SP)
├── Story 3.3: Schema Creation and Basic Editing (8 SP)
├── Story 3.4: Dynamic Field Management (13 SP)
├── Story 3.5: Advanced Field Operations (8 SP)
├── Story 3.6: Real-time Validation and Preview (8 SP)
├── Story 3.7: State Management Optimization (5 SP)
├── Story 3.8: Integration with Existing Components (8 SP)

└── Story 3.10: Styling and UX Polish (5 SP)
```

## Dependencies

**Critical Path:**
- 3.1 → 3.2 → 3.3 → 3.4 → 3.5

**Parallel Development:**
- 3.6 can start after 3.3 (validation/preview)
- 3.7 can start after 3.4 (state management)
- 3.9 can run parallel to any story after 3.2 (testing)

**Integration Phase:**
- 3.8 requires 3.3 + 3.7 (component integration)
- 3.10 requires most stories completed (final polish)

## Success Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
- [ ] Users can create and edit schemas for any project
- [ ] Default schema management works correctly (one per project)
- [ ] All schema field types supported with proper validation
- [ ] Real-time preview shows accurate schema form representation
- [ ] Integration with existing component creation workflows

**Technical Requirements:**
- [ ] Code follows existing architecture patterns
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage for schema management components
- [ ] Performance meets existing application standards
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Mobile responsive design

**User Experience Requirements:**
- [ ] Intuitive workflows that feel native to existing application
- [ ] Clear validation feedback and error handling
- [ ] Smooth transitions and professional appearance
- [ ] Collaborative access without permission barriers

## Risks & Mitigation

**Technical Risks:**
- **State Management Complexity:** Mitigated by incremental Context introduction
- **Performance with Large Schemas:** Addressed through virtualization and optimization
- **API Integration Challenges:** Leveraging existing comprehensive endpoint coverage

**Timeline Risks:**
- **Feature Scope Creep:** Clearly defined acceptance criteria and MVP focus
- **Integration Complexity:** Early integration story (3.8) validates approach
- **Testing Overhead:** Parallel testing development prevents end-loading

## Definition of Done

Epic considered complete when:
- [ ] All 10 stories meet individual acceptance criteria
- [ ] End-to-end user workflows tested and validated
- [ ] Integration with existing system verified
- [ ] Performance and accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Documentation updated with new functionality
