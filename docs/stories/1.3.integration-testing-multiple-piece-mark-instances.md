# Story 1.3: Integration Testing for Multiple Piece Mark Instances

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** quality assurance engineer,
**I want** comprehensive integration tests for the multiple piece mark instances feature,
**so that** I can verify that the end-to-end functionality works correctly and prevents regressions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. API integration tests cover component creation with instance_identifier
2. API integration tests verify multiple instances of same piece mark can be created in same drawing
3. API integration tests validate constraint enforcement (duplicate instance_identifier rejection)
4. Integration tests verify API responses include instance_identifier field correctly
5. Integration tests cover component update scenarios with instance_identifier
6. Integration tests validate backward compatibility (NULL instance_identifier handling)
7. All integration tests pass consistently in CI/CD pipeline

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
**Depends on**: 
- Story 1.1 (Database Schema Migration) - COMPLETED
- Story 1.2 (API Layer Integration) - REQUIRED

### Testing Requirements

**Critical Test Cases** [Source: QA Report]:

**Missing API Integration Tests**:
```python
def test_create_multiple_instances_same_piece_mark():
    """Test creating G1-A and G1-B in same drawing"""
    
def test_duplicate_instance_identifier_rejected():
    """Test that G1-A cannot be created twice in same drawing"""
    
def test_api_response_includes_instance_identifier():
    """Test API responses include the new field"""
    
def test_component_search_with_instance_identifier():
    """Test searching for specific instances"""
```

**Database Constraint Tests via API**:
```python 
def test_api_enforces_composite_unique_constraint():
    """Test API properly enforces (drawing_id, piece_mark, instance_identifier) uniqueness"""
```

### Test File Structure
```
backend/tests/
├── test_component_api_integration.py          # Main API integration tests
├── test_component_service_integration.py     # Service layer integration tests  
├── test_instance_identifier_constraints.py   # Constraint validation tests
├── test_instance_identifier_workflows.py     # End-to-end workflow tests
└── fixtures/
    └── test_data_instance_identifier.py      # Test data fixtures
```

### Testing Framework Configuration
**Backend Testing Framework** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- **Framework**: pytest + pytest-asyncio ^7.4.2 + ^0.21.1
- **Test Client**: FastAPI TestClient for API testing
- **Database**: Test database with full schema including instance_identifier migration

**Test Environment Setup**:
```python
# Test configuration for integration tests
TEST_DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/drawing_index_test"

@pytest.fixture
def test_client():
    """FastAPI test client with test database"""
    return TestClient(app)

@pytest.fixture 
def test_db():
    """Test database session with schema migration applied"""
    # Ensure test DB has latest migration (1.1) applied
```

### Test Data Management
**Test Drawing Creation**:
- Create test projects and drawings for isolation
- Use UUID-based test data for uniqueness
- Clean up test data after each test

**Test Component Scenarios**:
- Single instance components (backward compatibility)
- Multiple instances of same piece mark
- Mixed scenarios (some with instances, some without)
- Constraint violation scenarios

### Performance Test Integration
**Load Testing**:
- Test API performance with multiple instances
- Verify constraint validation doesn't impact performance
- Test concurrent component creation scenarios

### Test Coverage Requirements
**Minimum Coverage Targets**:
- API endpoint coverage: 100% for component CRUD with instance_identifier
- Service layer coverage: 95% for updated methods
- Constraint validation coverage: 100%

### CI/CD Configuration
**Pipeline Requirements**:
- All integration tests must pass before deployment
- Test coverage reporting must include new tests
- Test database must be available in CI environment
- Test results must be archived for analysis

**Test Execution Strategy**:
- Unit tests run first (fast feedback)

### Test Documentation
**Test Case Documentation**:
- Each test must have clear docstring explaining scenario
