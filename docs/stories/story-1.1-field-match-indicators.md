# Field-Specific Match Indicators - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **bridge engineer searching for components**,
I want **visual badges showing which specific fields contain my search matches**,
So that **I understand why the same component appears in different scope searches and can trust the system's intelligence**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: `SearchResultRow.tsx` component and search results display
- Technology: React 18 + TypeScript + Material-UI (Chip/Badge components)
- Follows pattern: Existing Material-UI Badge and Chip usage throughout the application
- Touch points: Search results rendering, search service response data, highlighting logic

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Visual Field Indicators**: Display badges/chips next to search results showing which fields contain matches (e.g., [Piece Mark] [Type] [Description])
2. **Scope-Aware Display**: Only show indicators for fields that actually contain the current search term
3. **Real-time Updates**: Indicators update immediately when search scope or terms change

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing search result highlighting continues to work unchanged
5. New indicator functionality follows existing Material-UI Badge/Chip pattern
6. Integration with SearchResultRow component maintains current search performance

**Quality Requirements (TDD Focus):**

7. **Test Coverage**: All indicator rendering logic covered by unit tests
8. **Performance Tests**: Verify no measurable impact on search result rendering time
9. **Accessibility Tests**: Indicators include proper ARIA labels and screen reader support
10. **Visual Regression Tests**: Verify existing search UI layout remains intact

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Extend SearchResultRow.tsx to analyze search response data and render field-match badges
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Use Material-UI Chip component similar to status indicators in ComponentEditor
- **Key Constraints**: Must not modify backend API - work with existing search response structure
- **TDD Strategy**: Write tests for badge visibility logic, field detection, and accessibility before implementation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Field match indicators render correctly for all search scopes
- [ ] Indicators update dynamically with search term and scope changes
- [ ] Existing search functionality regression tested and confirmed working
- [ ] Code follows existing React/TypeScript patterns and Material-UI component usage
- [ ] **TDD Complete**: Unit tests, integration tests, and accessibility tests all pass
- [ ] Visual design matches existing badge/chip styling in the application

## Test-Driven Development Requirements

**Required Test Coverage:**

1. **Unit Tests**: 
   - Field detection logic for search terms
   - Badge rendering based on field matches
   - Proper badge visibility rules

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Search scope changes update indicators correctly
   - Search term changes update indicators correctly
   - Performance impact measurement

3. **Accessibility Tests**:
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - ARIA label correctness
   - Keyboard navigation support

4. **Visual Tests**:
   - Badge positioning and styling
   - Responsive layout compatibility
   - Existing component layout preservation

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: UI layout disruption or performance impact on search results
- **Mitigation**: Use CSS Grid/Flexbox patterns already established in SearchResultRow
- **Rollback**: Feature can be disabled via CSS display property without code changes

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing search result components
- [ ] No backend API changes required
- [ ] UI changes follow existing Material-UI design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact measured and confirmed negligible (< 10ms additional render time)

**Development Estimate**: 2-3 hours focused development work
**Sprint Priority**: High (addresses immediate user confusion)
**Dependencies**: None - fully self-contained within existing frontend patterns
