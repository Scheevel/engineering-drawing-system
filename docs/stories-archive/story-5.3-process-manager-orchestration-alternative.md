# Story 5.3: Process Manager Orchestration Alternative

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** software developer on the Engineering Drawing Index System,
**I want** PM2 to manage all development processes (both native and containerized),
**so that** I have unified process management with excellent monitoring while keeping native Node.js performance.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: PM2 Configuration Setup
- **Given** I want unified process management
- **When** I create PM2 ecosystem configuration at project root
- **Then** it manages both native frontend and Docker backend services
- **And** all processes start/stop with single commands
- **And** process dependencies are respected with 5-second startup delays
- **And** configuration integrates with existing docker-compose.yml

### AC2: Native Frontend Performance
- **Given** I am developing the React frontend using PM2
- **When** I modify React components or files in frontend/src/
- **Then** hot module replacement responds within 1 second (measurable)
- **And** development tools integration remains identical to current npm start
- **And** debugging and profiling tools work without modification
- **And** PM2 memory overhead is less than 50MB

### AC3: Docker Service Integration
- **Given** I want backend services in containers managed by PM2
- **When** PM2 manages the docker-compose up process
- **Then** container lifecycle is controlled through PM2 commands
- **And** container logs are accessible through pm2 logs command
- **And** container health monitoring integrates with PM2 dashboard
- **And** PM2 gracefully handles Docker Compose shutdown (30s timeout)

### AC4: Process Monitoring Dashboard
- **Given** I want visibility into all development processes
- **When** I access PM2 monitoring via pm2 monit command
- **Then** I see status of all services (frontend + containers) in real-time
- **And** resource usage (CPU/memory) is monitored and displayed accurately
- **And** log aggregation provides unified viewing of frontend and backend logs
- **And** PM2 web dashboard shows process health at http://localhost:4000

### AC5: Development Workflow Integration
- **Given** I want simplified development commands
- **When** I use pm2 ecosystem commands
- **Then** `pm2 start ecosystem.config.js` launches complete environment in <30 seconds
- **And** `pm2 stop all` gracefully shuts down all services without orphaned processes
- **And** `pm2 restart all` handles rolling restarts appropriately
- **And** integration with existing Makefile and package.json scripts maintained

## Dev Notes

### Current Project Structure Context
Based on actual project files examination:

**Root Package.json Scripts (Current):**
- `"dev": "concurrently \"docker-compose up -d\" \"cd frontend && npm start\""`
- `"dev:stop": "docker-compose down && pkill -f 'npm start' || true"`
- `"dev:clean": "make dev-clean"`
- `"dev:status": "make dev-status"`

**Existing Docker Compose Files:**
- `docker-compose.yml` - Main backend services
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Development with frontend containerized (Story 5.2)
- `docker-compose-lite.yml` - Lightweight version

**Existing Makefile Commands:**
- `make dev-up` - Uses docker-compose.yml + frontend npm start
- `make dev-down` - Stops containers and kills npm processes
- `make dev-clean` - Calls scripts/cleanup-utilities.sh
- `make dev-status` - Calls scripts/status-monitoring.sh

**Project Structure for PM2 Integration:**
```
engineering-drawing-system-standalone/
├── package.json (root - add PM2 scripts here)
├── ecosystem.config.js (NEW - create here)
├── docker-compose.yml (existing - use for backend services)
├── Makefile (existing - add PM2 alternatives)
├── frontend/
│   ├── package.json (has npm start script)
│   └── src/ (React source code)
├── backend/ (containerized services)
└── scripts/
    ├── cleanup-utilities.sh (existing)
    └── status-monitoring.sh (existing)
```

**Technical Integration Points:**
- PM2 ecosystem.config.js must reference existing docker-compose.yml
- Frontend configuration points to frontend/package.json npm start
- Environment variables must match current development setup
- Integration with existing cleanup and monitoring scripts required
- Security: PM2 processes run with current user privileges, Docker containers isolated

**Dependency on Story 5.1:**
Story 5.1 provides immediate process management scripts that this story enhances with PM2 supervision. The cleanup-utilities.sh and status-monitoring.sh scripts from Story 5.1 must be integrated with PM2 monitoring.

### Testing

**Testing Requirements Based on Architecture:**
- Test location: Root directory for PM2 configuration testing
- Testing frameworks: Use existing npm test in frontend/, pytest in backend containers
- Performance testing: Benchmark HMR response times, measure PM2 overhead
- Integration testing: Verify PM2 works with existing Makefile and package.json scripts
- Security testing: Verify process isolation and privilege separation

**Specific Testing for This Story:**
- Frontend HMR performance must be within 1 second (vs current baseline)
- PM2 memory overhead must be under 50MB
- All existing development workflows must continue to work
- Process startup time must be under 30 seconds for complete environment
