# Story 5.1: Immediate Process Management Solution

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** software developer on the Engineering Drawing Index System,
**I want** unified commands to start and stop all development services,
**so that** I can avoid orphaned processes and inconsistent environment states.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Unified Start Command**
   - **Given** I want to start the complete development environment
   - **When** I run a single start command
   - **Then** all services (frontend, backend, database, cache, search) start correctly
   - **And** dependencies are respected in startup order

2. **Unified Stop Command**
   - **Given** I want to stop the complete development environment
   - **When** I run a single stop command
   - **Then** all Docker containers stop gracefully
   - **And** any orphaned Node.js processes are terminated

3. **Environment Cleanup Command**
   - **Given** I have development environment issues or want to reset
   - **When** I run the cleanup command
   - **Then** all containers are removed with volumes
   - **And** all Node.js processes on development ports are killed
   - **And** the environment is reset to a clean state

4. **Status Monitoring Command**
   - **Given** I want to check the current state of my development environment
   - **When** I run the status command
   - **Then** I see which services are running
   - **And** which ports are in use
   - **And** any potential conflicts are highlighted

5. **Backward Compatibility**
   - **Given** existing development workflows are in use
   - **When** the new commands are implemented
   - **Then** existing `npm start` and `docker-compose` commands continue working
   - **And** no breaking changes are introduced

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
First story in Epic 5 - Development Environment Orchestration. No previous story context available.

### Technical Context
[Source: docs/architect-development-environment-orchestration.md#phase-1-immediate-process-management]

**Problem Statement:** Current hybrid development mode creates process sprawl where Docker containers and native Node.js processes operate independently, causing:
- Frontend continues running after `docker-compose down`
- Multiple concurrent `npm start` processes creating resource conflicts
- Manual process hunting required (`lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9`)
- Inconsistent development environment state

**Solution Approach:** Implement Make-based commands for immediate relief without requiring major architectural changes.

### Technology Stack Context
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-stack]
- **Frontend Runtime:** Node.js 18.x with React 18.2.0
- **Build Tool:** React Scripts 5.0.1 with hot reload for development
- **Development Orchestration:** Docker Compose 3.8 for multi-service orchestration

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#infrastructure-stack]
- **Containerization:** Docker Compose 3.8 with 7-service microarchitecture
- **Development Tools:** Current development workflow uses `docker-compose up` and native `npm start`

### File Locations
**Project Structure Analysis:**
- **Project Root:** `/` (where Makefile will be created)
- **Frontend Location:** `./frontend/` (contains package.json and React application)
- **Docker Configuration:** `./docker-compose.yml` (existing orchestration file)
- **Root Package.json:** Currently missing, needs creation for development scripts

### Implementation Specifications

**Required Dependencies:**
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "concurrently": "^8.0.0"
  }
}
```

**Makefile Targets Required:**
- `dev-up`: Start Docker services + frontend with dependency order
- `dev-down`: Stop all services + cleanup Node.js processes
- `dev-clean`: Comprehensive environment reset with volume cleanup
- `dev-status`: Service status + port usage + process monitoring

**Process Management Commands:**
- Docker: `docker-compose up -d` and `docker-compose down -v`
- Node.js: `pkill -f "npm start"` and `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9`
- Port Management: Monitor ports 3000, 8001, 5432, 6379, 9200

### Error Handling Requirements
- Graceful fallbacks for missing processes (`|| true` patterns)
- Cross-platform shell compatibility (avoid platform-specific commands)
- Safe process killing (precise process matching to avoid unrelated processes)

### Testing Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

**Manual Testing Requirements:**
- Clean environment test (verify no orphaned processes after cleanup)
- Startup test (verify correct service order and accessibility)
- Shutdown test (verify graceful termination)
- Status monitoring test (verify accurate reporting)

**Test Framework:** Manual testing with verification commands
- Process verification: `ps aux | grep "npm start"`
- Port verification: `lsof -i :3000,8001,5432,6379,9200`
- Container verification: `docker-compose ps`

### Security Considerations
- Process cleanup must be precise to avoid killing unrelated processes
- Use process pattern matching instead of broad kill commands
- Ensure Docker cleanup doesn't affect other projects

### Performance Requirements
- Complete environment startup in <30 seconds
- Zero orphaned processes after any shutdown operation
- Minimal overhead for status monitoring commands
