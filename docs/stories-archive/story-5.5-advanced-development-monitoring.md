# Story 5.5: Advanced Development Monitoring

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** software developer on the Engineering Drawing Index System,
**I want** comprehensive monitoring and observability for my development environment,
**so that** I can quickly identify performance issues, resource bottlenecks, and service health problems during development work.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Service Health Dashboard
- **Given** I want visibility into development environment health
- **When** I access the monitoring dashboard
- **Then** I see real-time status of all services
- **And** health checks show green/yellow/red status indicators
- **And** response times and error rates are displayed

### AC2: Resource Monitoring
- **Given** I want to track resource usage during development
- **When** I monitor system resources
- **Then** I see CPU, memory, and disk usage for each service
- **And** resource trends over time
- **And** alerts when thresholds are exceeded

### AC3: Log Aggregation
- **Given** I need to troubleshoot issues across services
- **When** I access centralized logging
- **Then** logs from all services are aggregated and searchable
- **And** log levels can be filtered dynamically
- **And** correlation IDs connect related log entries

  - [ ] Create monitoring startup/shutdown scripts
  - [ ] Document monitoring access and usage for developers
  - [ ] Test monitoring stack with existing development workflows

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure Context
Based on existing development environment setup:
```
engineering-drawing-system-standalone/
├── docker-compose.yml (existing - extend for monitoring)
├── docker-compose.monitoring.yml (new - monitoring stack)
├── Makefile (existing - add monitoring commands)
├── monitoring/ (new directory)
│   ├── prometheus/
│   │   └── prometheus.yml
│   ├── grafana/
│   │   ├── dashboards/
│   │   └── provisioning/
│   ├── loki/
│   │   └── loki-config.yml
│   └── promtail/
│       └── promtail-config.yml
├── frontend/ (existing - add health endpoints)
└── backend/ (existing - add metrics endpoints)
```

### Technical Implementation Context
**Monitoring Stack Components:**
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and storage (port 9090)
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards (port 3001)
- **Loki**: Log aggregation and storage (port 3100)
- **Promtail**: Log collection agent

**Integration with Existing Services:**
- Backend FastAPI: Add prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator for automatic metrics
- Frontend React: Add performance monitoring via browser metrics
- Docker services: Automatic container metrics collection
- PM2 processes: Integrate with existing PM2 monitoring

**Port Allocation Strategy:**
- Avoid conflicts with existing services (3000 frontend, 8001 backend)
- Use standard monitoring ports where possible
- Document all port usage in monitoring setup

**Development Workflow Integration:**
- Extend existing Makefile with monitoring commands
- Integrate with existing dev-up/dev-down commands
- Provide monitoring access through existing developer workflows

**Dependencies from Previous Stories:**
- Story 5.1-5.4 provide foundation Docker environment and process management
- Builds on existing PM2 monitoring from Story 5.3
- Leverages Makefile enhancements from Story 5.4

### Testing

**Testing Requirements:**
- Monitoring stack health validation
- Service discovery and metrics collection verification
- Dashboard functionality testing
- Log aggregation and search testing
- Alert configuration validation

**Testing Approach:**
- Integration testing: Full monitoring stack deployment
- Functional testing: Dashboard access and data visualization
- Performance testing: Monitoring overhead measurement (<10% impact)
- Resilience testing: Service failure and recovery scenarios

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Deploy monitoring stack alongside existing development environment
2. Verify all services appear in Prometheus targets
3. Confirm dashboards display real-time metrics
4. Test log aggregation from all services
5. Validate alert triggering for resource thresholds
6. Verify monitoring stack survives service restarts
