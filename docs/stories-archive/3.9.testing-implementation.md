## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
**Source:** [docs/architecture.md] - Frontend Testing: Jest ^29.5.0 + React Testing Library ^13.4.0 for component and integration testing with accessible component queries.

**Dependency:** This story can run parallel to implementation stories (3.2+) and provides testing validation for all schema management functionality.

### Testing Strategy Overview
**Source:** [docs/architecture.md#tech-stack] - Testing approach focuses on component testing with React Testing Library patterns and accessible component queries.

**Testing Pyramid:**
- Unit Tests (70%): Individual components and hooks
- Integration Tests (20%): Component workflows and API integration
- End-to-End Tests (10%): Complete user workflows

### Test Infrastructure Design
**TestWrapper Configuration:**
```typescript
interface SchemaTestWrapperProps {
  children: ReactNode;
  initialSchemas?: ComponentSchema[];
  mockApiResponses?: Record<string, any>;
  routerInitialEntries?: string[];
  contextInitialState?: Partial<SchemaEditingState>;
}
```

**Mock Data Strategy:**
- Realistic schema configurations for different complexity levels
- Mock data for all supported field types
- Edge cases and boundary condition data
- Performance testing data (large schemas)

### Component Testing Patterns
**Testing Focus Areas:**
- Component rendering with different props and states
- User interaction handling (clicks, form input, keyboard)
- Error state rendering and recovery
- Loading state management
- Accessibility compliance

**Mock Strategy:**
- Mock all external dependencies (API, navigation, context)
- Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking
- Mock React Query with custom query client
- Mock navigation and routing for isolation

### React Query Testing
**Query Testing Patterns:**
- Mock API responses with success/error scenarios
- Test loading, error, and success states
- Verify cache invalidation strategies
- Test optimistic updates with rollback scenarios
- Test background refetching behavior

### Integration Testing Approach
**Workflow Testing:**
- Complete schema creation from start to finish
- Field management workflows with validation
- Cross-component communication and updates
- Navigation preservation and context switching

### Accessibility Testing Standards
**Source:** [docs/front-end-spec.md] - Accessibility requirements for engineering interfaces.

**Testing Requirements:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance validation
- Screen reader compatibility testing
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Focus management during dynamic updates
- Color contrast and visual indicator testing

### Performance Testing Methodology
**Performance Benchmarks:**

- Memory usage during extended editing sessions
- Debounce timing effectiveness
- Virtual scrolling performance
- Cache efficiency metrics

**Testing Tools:**
- React Testing Library performance utilities
- Browser memory profiling
- Custom timing utilities for debounce testing
- Virtual scrolling performance benchmarks

### Error Scenario Testing
**Error Types to Test:**
- Network failures and recovery
- API validation failures
- Concurrent editing conflicts
- Browser crash simulation
- Invalid data handling

### Test File Organization
**Test Structure:**
```
src/
├── components/schema-management/
│   ├── Component.test.tsx (adjacent to component)
├── hooks/schema/
│   ├── hookName.test.ts (adjacent to hook)
├── services/

└── test-utils/
    ├── SchemaTestWrapper.tsx
    ├── mockSchemaData.ts
    ├── schemaTestHelpers.ts
    └── accessibilityHelpers.ts
```

### Testing Environment Configuration
**Source:** Story 3.1 - Environment configuration provides test environment settings.

**Test Configuration:**
- Separate test environment variables
- Mock API endpoints for testing
- Test-specific feature flags
- Performance testing thresholds

### API Integration Requirements
**Mock API Endpoints:**
- All schema management CRUD operations
- Validation endpoints with success/failure scenarios
- Real-time validation with debounced responses
- Conflict resolution endpoints
- Usage analytics endpoints

### Testing

**Testing Standards:** [docs/architecture.md#tech-stack] - This story defines the testing standards for all other schema management stories.

**Coverage Requirements:**
- >80% code coverage for all schema management components
- >90% coverage for critical paths (schema creation, field management)
- 100% coverage for error handling scenarios
- Accessibility compliance validation for all interactive elements

**Continuous Integration:**
- Automated test runs on all pull requests
- Performance regression detection
- Accessibility compliance checking
- Visual regression testing with snapshots

**Test File Locations:**
All test files are co-located with their source files following React Testing Library best practices.
