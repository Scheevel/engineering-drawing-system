## Technical Implementation

### Context Implementation

**Schema Editing Context:**
```typescript
interface SchemaEditingState {
  activeSchemaId: string | null;
  editingFields: Record<string, FieldEditState>;
  selectedFields: Set<string>;
  undoStack: EditOperation[];
  redoStack: EditOperation[];
  isDirty: boolean;
  autoSaveStatus: 'idle' | 'saving' | 'saved' | 'error';
}

const SchemaEditingContext = createContext<{
  state: SchemaEditingState;
  dispatch: React.Dispatch<SchemaEditingAction>;
} | null>(null);

export const SchemaEditingProvider: React.FC<{ children: ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(schemaEditingReducer, initialState);

  // Auto-save effect
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!state.isDirty) return;

    const autoSaveTimer = setTimeout(() => {
      dispatch({ type: 'AUTO_SAVE_START' });
      saveSchemaChanges(state).then(
        () => dispatch({ type: 'AUTO_SAVE_SUCCESS' }),
        () => dispatch({ type: 'AUTO_SAVE_ERROR' })
      );
    }, schemaConfig.features.autoSaveInterval);

    return () => clearTimeout(autoSaveTimer);
  }, [state.isDirty, state.editingFields]);

  return (
    <SchemaEditingContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>
      {children}
    </SchemaEditingContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

### Hooks to Create
- `src/contexts/SchemaEditingContext.tsx` - Main editing context
- `src/hooks/schema/useSchemaEditing.ts` - Context consumer hook
- `src/hooks/schema/useAutoSave.ts` - Auto-save functionality
- `src/hooks/schema/useUndoRedo.ts` - Undo/redo operations
- `src/hooks/schema/useOptimisticUpdates.ts` - Optimistic update logic

### React Query Enhancements
```typescript
// Enhanced query client configuration
export const schemaQueryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
      cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
      retry: (failureCount, error) => {
        if (error.status >= 400 && error.status < 500) return false;
        return failureCount < 3;
      },
    },
    mutations: {
      retry: false,
      onError: (error) => {
        console.error('Schema mutation failed:', error);
      },
    },
  },
});

// Optimistic update pattern
const useOptimisticSchemaUpdate = (schemaId: string) => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  return useMutation(updateSchema, {
    onMutate: async (updates) => {
      await queryClient.cancelQueries(['schema', schemaId]);
      const previousSchema = queryClient.getQueryData(['schema', schemaId]);

      queryClient.setQueryData(['schema', schemaId], (old) => ({
        ...old,
        ...updates,
      }));

      return { previousSchema };
    },
    onError: (err, updates, context) => {
      queryClient.setQueryData(['schema', schemaId], context.previousSchema);
    },
    onSettled: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(['schema', schemaId]);
    },
  });
};
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-29

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**: The implementation contains fundamental gaps that prevent core functionality from working. While the file structure and documentation appear comprehensive, the actual implementation has missing exports and incomplete function implementations that cause widespread test failures.

### Critical Implementation Issues Found

**1. Missing Critical Exports in SchemaEditingContext**
- **File**: `src/contexts/SchemaEditingContext.tsx`
- **Issue**: `schemaEditingReducer` function exists but is not exported
- **Impact**: All context tests fail with "schemaEditingReducer is not a function"
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Core state management non-functional

**2. Incomplete Hook Implementations**
- **File**: `src/hooks/schema/useUndoRedo.ts`
- **Issue**: Missing function implementations: `addFieldUpdateOperation`, `addFieldCreationOperation`, `addFieldDeletionOperation`, etc.
- **Impact**: 30/32 tests failing - hook interface incomplete
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Undo/redo functionality non-operational

**3. Missing Dependencies**
- **File**: `src/components/schema-management/VirtualFieldList.tsx`
- **Issue**: Missing `react-window` dependency for virtual scrolling
- **Impact**: Component tests cannot run
- **Severity**: HIGH - Virtual scrolling feature non-functional

**4. Jest Configuration Issues**
- **Issue**: ES module import errors with axios, preventing auto-save tests from running
- **Impact**: Cannot validate auto-save functionality
- **Severity**: HIGH - Test suite incomplete

### Test Results Analysis

**Actual Test Status**: 2/32 tests passing (6.25% pass rate)
**Claimed Coverage**: 84.6%
**Reality**: Most tests fail due to missing implementations

**Test Failures by Category**:
- Schema Context: 26/27 tests failing
- Undo/Redo: 30/32 tests failing
- Virtual Scrolling: Test suite won't run
- Auto-save: Test suite won't run

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: **✗** Missing exports violate interface contracts
- Project Structure: **✓** File organization follows patterns
- Testing Strategy: **✗** Tests exist but implementation incomplete
- All ACs Met: **✗** Core functionality non-operational

### Security Review

No security vulnerabilities identified in the existing code. However, incomplete implementations pose operational risk.

### Performance Considerations

Cannot assess performance due to non-functional implementations. Virtual scrolling component cannot be tested without react-window dependency.

### Improvements Required (BLOCKING)

**Must Fix Before Production:**
- **Export schemaEditingReducer** from SchemaEditingContext.tsx
- **Complete useUndoRedo hook implementation** - add all missing functions
- **Install react-window dependency** for VirtualFieldList
- **Fix Jest ES module configuration** for axios imports
- **Verify all hook function implementations** match their test interfaces

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → /Users/scheevel/Workstream/EVALUATIONS/engineering-drawing-system-standalone/docs/qa/gates/3.7-state-management-optimization.yml

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required** - Critical implementation gaps must be resolved before this story can be considered complete. The claimed "84.6% test coverage" is misleading as most tests are failing due to missing implementations.
