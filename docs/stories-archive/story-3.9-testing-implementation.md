### Enhanced TestWrapper
```typescript
// Comprehensive test wrapper for schema components
interface SchemaTestWrapperProps {
  children: ReactNode;
  initialSchemas?: ComponentSchema[];
  mockApiResponses?: Record<string, any>;
  routerInitialEntries?: string[];
  contextInitialState?: Partial<SchemaEditingState>;
}

export const SchemaTestWrapper: React.FC<SchemaTestWrapperProps> = ({
  children,
  initialSchemas = [],
  mockApiResponses = {},
  routerInitialEntries = ['/'],
  contextInitialState = {},
}) => {
  const queryClient = new QueryClient({
    defaultOptions: {
      queries: { retry: false },
      mutations: { retry: false },
    },
  });

  const theme = createTheme({
    palette: {
      primary: { main: '#1976d2' },
      secondary: { main: '#dc004e' },
    },
  });

  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
        <MemoryRouter initialEntries={routerInitialEntries}>
          <SchemaEditingProvider initialState={contextInitialState}>
            {children}
          </SchemaEditingProvider>
        </MemoryRouter>
      </ThemeProvider>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
};
```

### Mock Data Generators
```typescript
// Mock schema data generators
export const createMockSchema = (overrides: Partial<ComponentSchema> = {}): ComponentSchema => ({
  id: 'mock-schema-' + Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9),
  project_id: 'mock-project-1',
  name: 'Test Schema',
  description: 'A test schema for unit testing',
  version: 1,
  is_default: false,
  is_active: true,
  created_at: '2024-01-01T00:00:00Z',
  updated_at: '2024-01-01T00:00:00Z',
  fields: [
    createMockField({ field_name: 'component_type', field_type: 'select' }),
    createMockField({ field_name: 'description', field_type: 'text' }),
  ],
  ...overrides,
});

export const createMockField = (overrides: Partial<ComponentSchemaField> = {}): ComponentSchemaField => ({
  id: 'mock-field-' + Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9),
  field_name: 'test_field',
  field_type: 'text',
  field_config: {},
  help_text: 'Test field help text',
  display_order: 0,
  is_required: false,
  is_active: true,
  ...overrides,
});
```

### Test Helper Examples
```typescript
// Complex interaction test helpers
export const testHelpers = {
  // Drag and drop testing
  async dragAndDrop(source: HTMLElement, target: HTMLElement) {
    fireEvent.dragStart(source);
    fireEvent.dragEnter(target);
    fireEvent.dragOver(target);
    fireEvent.drop(target);
    fireEvent.dragEnd(source);
  },

  // Multi-select testing
  async selectMultipleFields(fieldElements: HTMLElement[]) {
    for (const element of fieldElements) {
      await userEvent.click(element);
    }
  },

  // Form testing with validation
  async fillFormAndValidate(formData: Record<string, any>) {
    for (const [fieldName, value] of Object.entries(formData)) {
      const field = screen.getByLabelText(new RegExp(fieldName, 'i'));
      await userEvent.clear(field);
      await userEvent.type(field, value);
      await waitFor(() => {
        // Wait for validation to complete
        expect(field).not.toHaveAttribute('aria-invalid', 'true');
      });
    }
  },
};
```
