# Story 5.2: Complete Docker Containerization Strategy

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** software developer on the Engineering Drawing Index System,
**I want** the frontend to run in a Docker container alongside all other services,
**so that** I have complete environment isolation, reproducibility, and unified lifecycle management.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Frontend Docker Container
- **Given** I want to run the frontend in a container
- **When** I build the frontend Docker image
- **Then** it supports hot module replacement (HMR) for development
- **And** file changes are reflected immediately without rebuilding
- **And** Node.js dependencies are properly cached

### AC2: Development Docker Compose Configuration
- **Given** I want unified container orchestration
- **When** I create docker-compose.dev.yml
- **Then** it includes all services (frontend, backend, db, cache, search)
- **And** service dependencies are properly defined
- **And** volume mounts enable live code synchronization

### AC3: Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- **Given** I am developing in the containerized frontend
- **When** I modify React components or TypeScript files
- **Then** changes appear in the browser within 2 seconds
- **And** component state is preserved where possible
- **And** the development experience matches native npm start

### AC4: Unified Lifecycle Management
- **Given** I want to start the complete development environment
- **When** I run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`
- **Then** all services start in the correct dependency order
- **And** the frontend is accessible at http://localhost:3000
- **And** API communication works seamlessly between containers

### AC5: Developer Onboarding Simplification
- **Given** a new developer joins the team
- **When** they clone the repository
- **Then** they can run `git clone && docker-compose up` to get started
- **And** no Node.js installation is required on their machine
- **And** environment inconsistencies are eliminated

## Dev Notes

### Strategic Vision

**Philosophy:** "Everything in Docker" approach for complete development environment isolation, eliminating the hybrid Docker/native Node.js architecture that creates process sprawl and lifecycle management complexity.

**Current Problem:** Hybrid architecture creates process sprawl where Docker containers and native Node.js processes operate independently, causing frontend to continue running after `docker-compose down`, multiple concurrent `npm start` processes, and manual process hunting.

**Target Solution:** Fully containerized development with unified lifecycle management through Docker Compose.

### Technical Architecture Context

**Current Hybrid Architecture:**
```
Docker Containers (Backend/Services) ←→ Native Node.js Frontend (port 3000)
      ↓                                           ↓
   Isolated Lifecycle                    Independent Lifecycle
   docker-compose up/down               npm start/stop/kill
```

**Target Docker Architecture:**
```
Docker Compose Orchestration
├── Frontend Container (React + HMR)
├── Backend Container (FastAPI)
├── PostgreSQL Container
├── Redis Container
└── Elasticsearch Container
```

### Implementation Specifications

**Frontend Dockerfile.dev Configuration:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files for dependency caching
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=development

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Expose development port
EXPOSE 3000

# Start development server with HMR
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

**Docker Compose Service Configuration:**
```yaml
frontend:
  build:
    context: ./frontend
    dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
  ports:
    - "3000:3000"
  volumes:
    - ./frontend:/app
    - /app/node_modules  # Anonymous volume for node_modules
  environment:
    - REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8001
    - CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true  # For file watching in Docker
  depends_on:
    - backend
    - redis
    - postgres
  networks:
    - dev-network
```

**Hot Reload Configuration:**
```json
// frontend/.env.development
CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true
FAST_REFRESH=true
WDS_SOCKET_HOST=localhost
WDS_SOCKET_PORT=3000
```

**Resource Optimization:**
- Frontend: 512m memory, 0.5 CPU
- Backend: 1g memory, 1.0 CPU
- PostgreSQL: 256m memory, 0.25 CPU

### Benefits Analysis

**Development Environment Benefits:**
- Unified lifecycle management (`docker-compose up/down`)
- Complete environment isolation and reproducibility
- Consistent development experience across team members
- No port conflicts or process sprawl
- Simple onboarding (`git clone && docker-compose up`)

**Production Parity Benefits:**
- Environment consistency between dev and production
- "Works on my machine" problem elimination
- Dependency isolation and version consistency
- Network configuration matches production patterns

### Performance Considerations

**Development Speed Optimization:**
- Build caching for faster container rebuilds
- Volume mounts for live code synchronization
- Parallel service startup to reduce wait times
- Resource limits to prevent memory exhaustion

**File Watching Optimization:**
```bash
# Configure file watching for Docker volumes (Linux)
echo 'fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p
```

### Security Considerations

**Development Environment Security:**
- Network isolation through Docker networks
- Secrets management via environment files (never committed)
- Port exposure control limiting attack surface
- Process privilege separation preventing system-wide impacts

### Migration Strategy

**Phase 1: Preparation**
- Create frontend Dockerfile.dev
- Test containerized frontend independently
- Verify HMR functionality

**Phase 2: Integration**
- Create docker-compose.dev.yml
- Test complete containerized environment
- Optimize resource allocation

**Phase 3: Team Migration**
- Update development documentation
- Conduct team training sessions
- Provide migration assistance

### Rollback Plan

**If issues arise during implementation:**
1. Keep existing native development workflow available
2. Provide clear rollback instructions
3. Document known issues and workarounds
4. Gradual team migration rather than forced adoption

### Critical Success Factors

The containerized environment must provide identical or superior developer experience compared to native Node.js development.

**Implementation Principle:** Development/Production Parity
- Eliminates environment differences between dev and production
- Uses identical container technologies across environments
- Provides consistent dependency management and network configuration

### Testing

#### Development Experience Testing
- Frontend file changes must reflect in browser within 2 seconds
- Component state preservation during hot reloads
- API calls must work correctly between containers
- Console logging and debugging tools must function properly

#### Environment Testing
- Complete environment starts successfully on clean system
- All services accessible at expected ports
- Database migrations run correctly in containerized environment
- File permissions work correctly across host/container boundary

#### Performance Testing
- Container startup time <30 seconds for complete environment
- Memory usage within acceptable limits (<4GB total)
- CPU usage doesn't interfere with other development tools
- File watching performance acceptable for large codebases
