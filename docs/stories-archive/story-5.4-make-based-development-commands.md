# Story 5.4: Make-Based Development Commands Enhancement

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** software developer on the Engineering Drawing Index System,
**I want** enhanced Make commands with cross-platform support and missing developer workflow features,
**so that** I have a complete and robust development command interface on all platforms.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Cross-Platform Detection and Behavior
- **Given** I am using the Makefile on different operating systems
- **When** I run make commands
- **Then** platform-specific behaviors are automatically detected and applied
- **And** commands work consistently on macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL)

### AC2: Enhanced Developer Workflow Commands
- **Given** I need additional development workflow support
- **When** I use enhanced make commands
- **Then** I have access to dev-debug, dev-test, dev-reset, and dev-open commands
- **And** commands provide appropriate error handling for missing dependencies

### AC3: Improved Error Handling and Feedback
- **Given** dependencies or tools may be missing from my environment
- **When** I run make commands
- **Then** clear error messages guide me to install missing requirements
- **And** commands gracefully handle missing tools with fallbacks where appropriate

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Add Cross-Platform Detection (AC: 1)
  - [x] Add platform detection variables (UNAME_S, PLATFORM) to Makefile
  - [x] Implement platform-specific dev-open command for browser launching
  - [x] Test platform detection on macOS, Linux, and Windows WSL

- [x] Task 2: Implement Missing Developer Commands (AC: 2)
  - [x] Add dev-debug command with DEBUG environment variable support
  - [x] Add dev-test command that runs both frontend and backend test suites
  - [x] Add dev-reset command for complete environment rebuild
  - [x] Add dev-open command for automatic browser launching

- [x] Task 3: Enhance Error Handling (AC: 3)
  - [x] Add dependency checks for docker-compose, npm, python
  - [x] Implement graceful fallbacks for missing optional tools
  - [x] Add clear error messages with installation guidance
  - [x] Test error scenarios with missing dependencies

- [x] Task 4: Documentation and Testing (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [x] Update help system to include new commands
  - [x] Test all commands on multiple platforms
  - [x] Document platform-specific behaviors
  - [x] Validate error handling scenarios

## Dev Notes

### Current Makefile Analysis
Based on examination of the existing Makefile at project root:

**Existing Commands (Already Implemented):**
- Basic commands: dev-up, dev-down, dev-restart
- Maintenance: dev-clean, dev-status
- Selective cleanup: clean-nodejs, clean-ports, clean-docker, test-cleanup
- Status monitoring: status-docker, status-ports, status-nodejs, status-health
- Development: dev-logs
- PM2 integration: pm2-start, pm2-stop, pm2-restart, pm2-status, pm2-logs, pm2-monitor, pm2-clean

**Identified Gaps (This Story's Focus):**
- No cross-platform detection (current Makefile uses generic commands)
- Missing dev-debug command with debug environment support
- Missing dev-test command for comprehensive test running
- Missing dev-reset command for complete environment rebuild
- Missing dev-open command for browser automation
- Limited error handling for missing dependencies
- No platform-specific behaviors (e.g., different browser opening methods)

**Technical Implementation Context:**
- Platform detection using `$(shell uname -s)` and conditional logic
- Error handling using command existence checks with `command -v`
- Browser opening: `open` on macOS, `xdg-open` on Linux
- Test execution: frontend `npm test`, backend `python -m pytest`
- Debug support: environment variable injection

### Project Structure Context
```
engineering-drawing-system-standalone/
├── Makefile (existing - enhance with new commands)
├── frontend/ (React app with npm test)
├── backend/ (Python app with pytest)
├── docker-compose.yml (existing Docker setup)
└── scripts/ (existing utility scripts)
```

### Testing

**Testing Requirements:**
- Cross-platform testing on macOS, Linux, Windows WSL
- Error scenario testing with missing dependencies
- Integration testing with existing command workflows
- Validation of platform-specific behaviors

**Testing Approach:**
- Unit testing: Individual command validation
- Integration testing: Command interaction with existing workflows
- Platform testing: Multi-OS validation
- Error testing: Missing dependency scenarios
