# Story 3.4-deps: Dependency Resolution for Dynamic Field Management

**Epic**: Schema Management UI  
**Story Type**: Technical Debt / Prerequisites  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Must be completed before 3.4A, 3.4B, 3.4C  
**Points**: 8  
**Status**: Ready  

## Story Description

Resolve all missing dependencies and prerequisites identified during validation of Stories 3.4A, 3.4B, and 3.4C. This story addresses critical infrastructure gaps that would block implementation of the dynamic field management features.

## Business Value

- **Risk Mitigation**: Prevents implementation delays by resolving dependencies upfront
- **Quality Assurance**: Establishes performance baselines and error handling patterns
- **Technical Foundation**: Ensures robust infrastructure for advanced field management features

## User Story

**As a** development team  
**I want** all dependencies and prerequisites resolved  
**So that** Stories 3.4A, 3.4B, and 3.4C can be implemented without technical blockers

**API Integration Patterns:**
- Base URL: `http://localhost:8001/api/v1`
- Error handling: Axios interceptors with 401 redirect to login
- Authentication: Bearer token from localStorage
- Request timeout: 30 seconds

**Current Library Status:**
- ❌ **react-beautiful-dnd**: NOT installed - needs resolution
- ✅ **react-dropzone**: Available (14.2.0) - for file uploads only
- ✅ **Material-UI**: Full v5 component library available
- ✅ **React Hook Form**: Advanced form management available

**Backend API Status (verified against /backend/app/api/schemas.py):**
- ✅ Schema CRUD operations fully implemented
- ✅ Field CRUD operations implemented
- ✅ Schema validation endpoint available
- ❌ Field reordering endpoint missing
- ❌ Default schema set/unset endpoints missing
- ❌ Field-specific validation missing
- ❌ Field duplication endpoint missing

**Frontend API Client Dependencies:**
- setDefaultSchema() and unsetDefaultSchema() functions exist in api.ts
- These functions expect POST/DELETE endpoints that don't exist in backend
- React Query hooks useSetDefaultSchema/useUnsetDefaultSchema exist

**Development Commands:**
- Start dev server: `npm start` (runs on localhost:3000)
- Run tests: `npm test`
- Type checking: `npm run type-check`
- Linting: `npm run lint` and `npm run lint:fix`
- Build: `npm run build`

**Critical Dependencies for 3.4 Stories:**
1. Drag-and-drop library selection affects all field reordering functionality
2. Missing backend endpoints block API-dependent features
3. Performance baselines needed for optimization targets
