## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
**Source:** [docs/architecture.md] - Multi-stage validation with business rules, duplicate detection, and data integrity checks ensuring data quality with immediate user feedback.

**Dependency:** This story builds on Story 3.4A (Core Field Management) and extends the basic field configuration with advanced type-specific options and validation rules.

### Field Configuration System Design
**Configuration Storage Strategy:**
- Each field type has specific configuration schema
- Configuration stored in `field_config` JSON field
- Validation rules stored separately for performance
- Template configurations cached for reuse

**Configuration Interface Pattern:**
```typescript
interface FieldTypeConfig {
  text: {
    multiline?: boolean;
    maxLength?: number;
    pattern?: string;
    placeholder?: string;
    formatHint?: string;
  };
  number: {
    min?: number;
    max?: number;
    step?: number;
    integerOnly?: boolean;
    unit?: string;
    decimalPlaces?: number;
  };
  // ... other field types
}
```

### Validation Engine Architecture
**Cross-Field Validation System:**
- Rule-based validation engine with dependency tracking
- Performance optimization for complex validation chains
- Real-time validation with debounced execution
- Validation error aggregation and display

**Validation Rule Types:**
- Comparison rules: field A > field B
- Conditional requirements: required if condition met
- Format validation: pattern matching with context
- Range validation: within acceptable engineering limits

### Engineering Field Templates
**Pre-defined Templates:**
- Structural dimensions with unit validation
- Material properties with standard ranges
- Load ratings with safety factor validation
- Geometric properties with relationship rules

### API Integration Requirements
**Expected API Endpoints:**
- `getFieldTemplates()` - Retrieve available field templates
- `saveFieldTemplate(templateData)` - Save custom template
- `validateFieldConfiguration(config)` - Validate configuration
- `testValidationRules(rules, sampleData)` - Test validation rules

### Component Integration
**Integration with Story 3.4A:**
- Advanced configuration panels appear when field type selected
- Configuration options dynamically rendered based on field type
- Configuration validation integrated with field creation/editing
- Preview functionality shows how configuration affects component forms

### Performance Considerations
**Configuration Performance:**
- Lazy loading of configuration components
- Debounced validation for real-time feedback
- Caching of template configurations
- Performance warnings for complex validation rules

### Testing

**Testing Standards:** [docs/architecture.md#tech-stack] - Jest + React Testing Library for component testing with emphasis on complex form interactions.

**Testing Requirements for this Story:**
- Type-specific configuration component testing
- Cross-field validation rule testing with various scenarios
- Template system testing (save, load, apply)
- Performance testing for complex validation rules
- Integration testing with Story 3.4A components

**Test File Locations:**
- `src/components/schema-forms/TextFieldConfig.test.tsx`
- `src/components/schema-forms/NumberFieldConfig.test.tsx`
- `src/components/schema-management/CrossFieldValidation.test.tsx`
- `src/hooks/schema/useAdvancedValidation.test.ts`
- `src/utils/fieldConfigValidation.test.ts`

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent implementation quality for completed portions** - The type-specific configuration components demonstrate professional-grade code with comprehensive engineering-focused features. Architecture follows established patterns from Story 3.4A with React Hook Form integration, 300ms debouncing, and Material-UI accordion patterns. Component design is modular and well-abstracted.

**However, this represents only ~20% completion of the full story scope** - Only the first task group (AC 1-5) has been implemented, while critical features including cross-field validation, advanced validation systems, and integration components remain undelivered.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `src/components/schema-forms/TextFieldConfig.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed multiple test failures related to input handling and element selection
  - **Why**: Tests were failing due to userEvent.type() issues with regex characters and ambiguous element selection
  - **How**: Applied fireEvent.change() for direct value setting and getByRole() for precise element targeting
  - **Result**: All 23 tests now passing (TEST-001 ✅ **RESOLVED**)

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Excellent adherence to React/TypeScript patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows established component organization
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage with React Testing Library
- All ACs Met: ✗ **CRITICAL: Only ACs 1-5 completed, ACs 6-8 not implemented**

### Improvements Checklist

**Completed by QA:**
- [x] Fixed failing test for character limit input (TextFieldConfig.test.tsx)

**Outstanding Requirements (Dev to Address):**
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Implement Cross-Field Validation Rules (AC 6)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Build Advanced Validation System (AC 8)
- [ ] **HIGH**: Create Field Configuration Templates service layer (AC 7)
- [ ] **HIGH**: Integrate with Core Field Management (Integration task)
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Add missing validation rule testing interface
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Implement performance monitoring for complex rules
- [x] **LOW**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Fixed all test failures (TEST-001 addressed)

### Security Review

**No security concerns identified** in the implemented configuration components. These are frontend UI components for form configuration without direct security implications.

### Performance Considerations

**Well-architected for performance:**
- Lazy loading ready (accordion pattern)
- 300ms debouncing prevents excessive onChange calls
- Component mocking in tests indicates good separation of concerns
- Template caching considerations documented but not yet implemented

### Files Modified During Review

- `src/components/schema-forms/TextFieldConfig.test.tsx` - Fixed failing test

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/3.4B-advanced-field-configuration.yml
Risk profile: Not required (frontend configuration components, low risk domain)

### Recommended Status

**✓ Story Split Implemented - Part 1 Complete**

**Rationale:** Following developer recommendation for Option B (Story Split), the completed portion (ACs 1-5) represents a cohesive, production-ready feature set that delivers significant value. The type-specific field configuration system is complete with comprehensive testing and follows established architectural patterns.

**Resolution Applied:**
1. **Story 3.4B (Current)**: Rescoped to cover completed ACs 1-5 - Type-specific field configuration components ✅ **COMPLETE**
2. **Story 3.4C (New)**: Created for remaining ACs 6-8 - Advanced validation and template management systems

**Part 1 Deliverables (Complete):**
- ✅ Type-specific configuration components for all 5 field types
- ✅ Dynamic configuration interface with field type switching
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (23/23 tests passing)
- ✅ Engineering-focused templates and patterns
- ✅ React Hook Form integration with optimized debouncing

**Part 2 Requirements (Story 3.4C):**
- Cross-field validation rules engine
- Advanced validation system with performance monitoring
- Field configuration templates service layer
- Integration with core field management workflow
