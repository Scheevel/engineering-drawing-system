# Story 3.7: State Management Optimization

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** frontend developer,
**I want** optimized state management for schema editing,
**so that** complex schema operations are performant and provide excellent user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Schema Editing Context Implementation**
   - Create React Context for complex schema editing state
   - Context provider wraps schema editing components and pages
   - Type-safe context interface with TypeScript
   - Proper context initialization and cleanup

2. **Field Operations State Management**
   - State management for field operations (add, edit, remove, reorder)
   - Track multiple concurrent field edits
   - Manage field selection state for bulk operations
   - Handle field validation state across multiple fields

3. **Undo/Redo Functionality**
   - Implement undo/redo stack for schema modifications
   - Support for field-level and schema-level operations
   - Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y) for undo/redo
   - Visual indicators for undo/redo availability
   - Limit undo stack size for memory management

4. **Dirty State Tracking**
   - Track unsaved changes across schema and field modifications
   - Visual indicators for unsaved changes (asterisk, color changes)
   - Confirmation dialog when navigating away with unsaved changes
   - Auto-save integration with dirty state management

5. **React Query Optimization**
   - Optimistic updates for schema operations before API response
   - Intelligent cache invalidation for schema-related data
   - Background refetching strategy for stale data
   - Error recovery and retry logic with exponential backoff

6. **Auto-save Functionality**
   - Configurable auto-save intervals via environment variables
   - Auto-save only when dirty state exists
   - Pause auto-save during active editing (user is typing)
   - Auto-save status indicators ("Saving...", "Saved", "Failed")

7. **Performance Optimization**
   - Debounced state updates to prevent excessive re-renders
   - Memoization of expensive schema validation calculations
   - Virtual scrolling for schemas with 50+ fields
   - Memory leak prevention with proper cleanup

8. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Detect concurrent edits by multiple users/sessions
   - Conflict resolution interface for competing changes
   - Option to merge changes or choose version to keep
   - Backup of user's changes during conflict resolution

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
**Source:** [docs/architecture.md] - State Management: React Query ^3.39.0 + React Hook Form ^7.45.0 for server state + form state management with optimistic updates and conflict resolution.

**Dependency:** This story builds on Stories 3.4A-C (Field Management) to provide optimized state management for the complex field operations and editing workflows.

### Context Architecture Design
**Source:** [docs/architecture.md#architectural-patterns] - Component-based architecture with sophisticated editing modals and real-time validation requiring efficient state management.

**Context Structure:**
```typescript
interface SchemaEditingState {
  activeSchemaId: string | null;
  editingFields: Record<string, FieldEditState>;
  selectedFields: Set<string>;
  undoStack: EditOperation[];
  redoStack: EditOperation[];
  isDirty: boolean;
  autoSaveStatus: 'idle' | 'saving' | 'saved' | 'error';
  conflictResolution?: ConflictResolutionState;
}
```

### React Query Optimization Strategy
**Source:** [docs/architecture.md#tech-stack] - React Query ^3.39.0 for optimistic updates with conflict resolution.

**Optimization Patterns:**
- Optimistic updates with immediate UI feedback
- Smart cache invalidation to preserve unrelated data
- Background refetching for long-lived schema editing sessions
- Query deduplication for simultaneous schema operations

### Undo/Redo Implementation
**Operation Types:**
- Field addition/removal operations
- Field configuration changes
- Field reordering operations
- Schema-level property changes
- Bulk field operations

**Stack Management:**
- Maximum 50 operations in undo stack
- Serialize complex operations for efficient storage
- Group related operations for better user experience
- Clear stack on schema save to prevent memory bloat

### Auto-save Strategy
**Auto-save Triggers:**
- Dirty state changes with debounced timing
- User inactivity for configurable duration
- Before navigation or browser close events
- After significant operation completion

**Conflict Resolution:**
- Last-write-wins with user notification
- Manual conflict resolution interface
- Change highlighting for user review
- Rollback capability during conflict resolution

### Performance Optimization Techniques
**State Update Optimization:**
- Debounced state updates (300ms default)
- Batched operations for multiple field changes
- Selective component re-rendering with dependency arrays
- Memoization of expensive calculations

**Memory Management:**
- Context provider cleanup on unmount
- Event listener cleanup for keyboard shortcuts
- Clear cached data when no longer needed
- Monitor memory usage during long editing sessions

### API Integration Requirements
**Expected API Endpoints:**
- `saveSchemaChanges(schemaId, changes)` - Save accumulated changes
- `getSchemaConflicts(schemaId, lastModified)` - Check for conflicts
- `resolveSchemaConflict(schemaId, resolution)` - Resolve conflicts
- `validateSchemaState(schemaData)` - Validate current state

### Integration with Existing Components
**Component Integration Points:**
- Schema editing interface from Story 3.3
- Field management components from Stories 3.4A-C
- Validation system from Story 3.6
- All schema management components need context integration

### Environment Configuration
**Source:** Story 3.1 - Environment configuration setup provides foundation for auto-save and performance settings.

**Configuration Variables:**
- `REACT_APP_SCHEMA_AUTO_SAVE_INTERVAL` - Auto-save frequency
- `REACT_APP_SCHEMA_UNDO_STACK_SIZE` - Maximum undo operations
- `REACT_APP_SCHEMA_DEBOUNCE_DELAY` - State update debouncing
- `REACT_APP_SCHEMA_CONFLICT_CHECK_INTERVAL` - Conflict detection frequency

### Testing

**Testing Standards:** [docs/architecture.md#tech-stack] - Jest + React Testing Library for component testing with focus on state management and async operations.

**Testing Requirements for this Story:**
- Context provider state management testing
- Undo/redo functionality testing with complex operations
- React Query optimization testing with mock API responses
- Auto-save timing and conflict resolution testing
- Performance testing with large schemas and long editing sessions
- Memory leak testing for extended usage scenarios

**Test File Locations:**
- `src/contexts/SchemaEditingContext.test.tsx`
- `src/hooks/schema/useSchemaEditing.test.ts`
- `src/hooks/schema/useUndoRedo.test.ts`
- `src/hooks/schema/useAutoSave.test.ts`
- `src/hooks/schema/useOptimisticUpdates.test.ts`

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-29

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

**Status**: This is the DRAFT version of Story 3.7.

**Implementation Status**: The implementation was attempted in `story-3.7-state-management-optimization.md` but contains critical issues.

**QA Decision**: See primary story file `story-3.7-state-management-optimization.md` for complete QA review.

**Gate**: FAIL - Critical implementation gaps prevent functionality

**Updated Status (Post-Remediation)**: Critical infrastructure blocking issues have been resolved by Dev Agent James. The story has made substantial progress with test pass rates improving from 6.25% to 20.3%. However, implementation refinements are still needed before archival.

**Gate Status**: CONCERNS (improved from FAIL) - Medium-priority implementation gaps remain but no longer blocking.

**Recommendation**: This draft file should remain as reference. The main implementation requires final refinements before completion.
