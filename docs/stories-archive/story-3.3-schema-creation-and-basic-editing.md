# Story 3.3: Schema Creation and Basic Editing

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** railroad bridge engineer,
**I want** to create and edit component type schemas for my projects,
**so that** I can define the data structure that best fits my project's component requirements

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Create Schema Dialog/Form** - Modal dialog accessible from schema list with "Create Schema" button, form fields (name required, description optional, project selection), support both global and project-specific creation, form validation with real-time feedback, consistent with existing application modal patterns

2. **Schema Name Validation** - Validate schema name uniqueness within project scope, prevent duplicate names with clear error messaging, minimum and maximum length validation (3-100 characters), alphanumeric + common characters allowed, real-time validation feedback during typing

3. **Project Context Handling** - When creating from project context automatically set project_id, global schema creation when accessed from `/schemas` route, clear indication of schema scope (global vs project-specific), project selection dropdown when creating global schema that can be copied to projects

4. **Creation Error Handling** - Handle API errors during schema creation with user-friendly messages, network error recovery with retry options, validation error display with specific field guidance, success feedback with option to immediately edit schema

5. **Post-Creation Navigation** - Redirect to schema editing page after successful creation, option to "Create and Add Fields" vs "Create and Return to List", proper URL structure for new schema editing

6. **Edit Mode Toggle** - Transform SchemaManagementCard from view mode to edit mode, save/cancel buttons with appropriate loading states, confirm dialog for unsaved changes when canceling, visual indication of edit mode (different styling/borders)

7. **Editable Fields** - Schema name editing with validation (same rules as creation), description editing with multiline text support, real-time character count for description field, form state management with React Hook Form

8. **Save Functionality** - Save changes via API with optimistic updates, handle concurrent editing conflicts gracefully, success feedback with updated schema information, automatic return to view mode after successful save

9. **Cancel Functionality** - Revert all changes to original values, confirmation dialog if unsaved changes exist, return to view mode without API calls, clear any validation errors

10. **Default Toggle Interface** - Checkbox or toggle button for "Set as Default Schema", clear visual indication of current default status, disabled state when schema is already default, accessible labels and keyboard navigation

11. **Default Schema Logic** - Ensure only one default schema per project at any time, automatically unset previous default when setting new default, API call to update default status with proper error handling, real-time UI updates across all schema components

12. **Default Change Confirmation** - Confirmation dialog when changing default schema, explain impact: "This will make [Schema Name] the default for new components", option to cancel default change, success feedback when default change completes

13. **Default Schema Indicators** - Update star icons immediately when default changes, update schema list sorting/filtering, refresh any cached schema data, consistent indicators across all UI components

14. **Form Setup and Validation** - Use React Hook Form for all schema editing forms, TypeScript typing for form data interfaces, validation rules matching API requirements, custom validation for business logic (unique names, etc.)

15. **Error State Management** - Field-level error display with clear messaging, form-level error summary for complex validation failures, server-side error integration with form state, clear error state when user corrects issues

16. **Form Performance** - Debounced validation for real-time feedback, prevent unnecessary re-renders during typing, efficient form state updates, proper cleanup of form subscriptions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 3.2 established the foundation with SchemaManagementCard component and useSchemaManagement hook
- Existing React Hook Form patterns and Material-UI components provide the foundation for form implementation
- Schema API endpoints already exist for creation, update, and default management operations

### Component Architecture
**New Components to Create:**
- `src/components/schema-management/SchemaCreateDialog.tsx` - Modal dialog for schema creation
- `src/components/schema-management/DefaultSchemaToggle.tsx` - Toggle control for default schema management
- `src/pages/schema/SchemaEditPage.tsx` - Dedicated page for schema editing

**Components to Enhance:**
- `src/components/schema-management/SchemaManagementCard.tsx` - Add edit mode functionality

### Hook Architecture
**Custom Hooks to Create:**
- `src/hooks/schema/useSchemaValidation.ts` - Centralized validation logic for schema forms
- `src/hooks/schema/useDefaultSchemaToggle.ts` - Default schema state management
- `src/hooks/schema/useSchemaForm.ts` - Form state management with React Hook Form integration

### API Integration Patterns
```typescript
// Schema creation mutation pattern
const createSchemaMutation = useMutation(createSchema, {
  onSuccess: (newSchema) => {
    queryClient.invalidateQueries(['projectSchemas', projectId]);
    navigate(`/schemas/${newSchema.id}/edit`);
  },
  onError: (error) => {
    setError('Failed to create schema. Please try again.');
  },
});

// Default schema toggle with optimistic updates
const setDefaultMutation = useMutation(setDefaultSchema, {
  onMutate: async ({ schemaId }) => {
    const previousData = queryClient.getQueryData(['projectSchemas', projectId]);
    queryClient.setQueryData(['projectSchemas', projectId], (old) => ({
      ...old,
      schemas: old.schemas.map(schema => ({
        ...schema,
        is_default: schema.id === schemaId
      }))
    }));
    return { previousData };
  },
  onError: (err, variables, context) => {
    queryClient.setQueryData(['projectSchemas', projectId], context.previousData);
  },
});
```

### Form Implementation Standards
- Use React Hook Form for all form state management
- Implement yup schema validation for all forms
- Follow TypeScript best practices with proper interface definitions
- Use Material-UI form components consistently
- Implement debounced validation for real-time feedback
- Proper cleanup of form subscriptions to prevent memory leaks

### File Locations and Naming Conventions
- Dialog components: `src/components/schema-management/`
- Page components: `src/pages/schema/`
- Custom hooks: `src/hooks/schema/`
- Test files: Co-located with components using `.test.tsx` suffix

### Technical Constraints
- React 18 + TypeScript patterns
- Material-UI 5.x component library
- React Query for state management
- React Hook Form for form handling
- Yup for validation schemas

### Testing
**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests for all new components using React Testing Library
- Hook testing using @testing-library/react-hooks
- Integration tests for complete user workflows
- Error scenario testing for API failures
- Accessibility testing for form controls

**Test File Locations:**
- `src/components/schema-management/SchemaCreateDialog.test.tsx`
- `src/components/schema-management/SchemaManagementCard.test.tsx` (enhanced)
- `src/hooks/schema/useDefaultSchemaToggle.test.ts`

**Testing Standards:**
- Minimum 80% test coverage for new components
- Test user interactions, not implementation details
- Mock API calls using React Query testing utilities
- Test accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### Testing Issues ⚠️

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
- **Missing test files**: `SchemaCreateDialog.test.tsx`, `DefaultSchemaToggle.test.tsx` not implemented
- **Test failures**: 6 of 33 existing tests failing due to mock setup issues with `useSchemaUsageStats`
- **Coverage gaps**: New custom hooks lack comprehensive unit tests
- **Integration testing**: Complete user workflows not tested

**Mock Infrastructure Problems:**
```
Cannot destructure property 'data' of '(0 , _schemaQueries.useSchemaUsageStats)(...)' as it is undefined
```

### Requirements for Story Completion

**Must Fix Before Archive:**
1. Implement missing test files for all new components
2. Resolve mock configuration issues affecting existing test suite
3. Add comprehensive unit tests for all three custom hooks
4. Implement integration tests for complete user workflows
5. Achieve minimum 80% test coverage for new components

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days for testing implementation completion

### Recommendation
**DO NOT ARCHIVE** - Story requires testing implementation completion before production readiness. Implementation quality is excellent and demonstrates sophisticated understanding of React patterns, but quality gate standards require comprehensive test coverage for release approval.
