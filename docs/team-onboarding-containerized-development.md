# Team Onboarding Guide: Containerized Development

## Welcome to Containerized Development!

This guide helps team members transition from the hybrid Docker/native Node.js development environment to a fully containerized development workflow.

## Migration Overview

### Why We're Migrating

**Problems with Hybrid Development:**
- Frontend continues running after `docker-compose down`
- Multiple concurrent `npm start` processes creating conflicts
- Manual process hunting required (`lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9`)
- Inconsistent development environment states
- "Works on my machine" problems

**Benefits of Full Containerization:**
- âœ… Unified lifecycle management (`docker-compose up/down`)
- âœ… Complete environment isolation and reproducibility
- âœ… Consistent development experience across team members
- âœ… No port conflicts or process sprawl
- âœ… Simple onboarding (`git clone && docker-compose up`)

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation (Individual)
**Duration:** 1-2 days per developer
**Goal:** Prepare for containerized development

#### Step 1: Update Docker Desktop
```bash
# Ensure Docker Desktop is updated to latest version
docker --version  # Should be 20.10+ or later
docker-compose --version  # Should be 3.8+ or later
```

#### Step 2: Allocate Docker Resources
**Recommended Docker Desktop Settings:**
- **Memory:** 6GB minimum (8GB preferred)
- **CPUs:** 4 cores minimum
- **Disk:** 20GB available space

**Configure in Docker Desktop â†’ Settings â†’ Resources**

#### Step 3: Pull Latest Code
```bash
git pull origin main
```

#### Step 4: Test Containerized Environment
```bash
# Stop any running services
docker-compose down
pkill -f "npm start" || true

# Test new containerized environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Verify in browser: http://localhost:3000
# Should see frontend with HMR working
```

#### Step 5: File Watching Optimization (Linux Only)
```bash
./scripts/optimize-file-watching.sh
```

### Phase 2: Integration (Team Coordination)
**Duration:** 1 week
**Goal:** Team-wide adoption and issue resolution

#### Week 1: Gradual Adoption
**Monday-Tuesday:** Early adopters test containerized workflow
**Wednesday-Thursday:** Mid-team adoption with peer support
**Friday:** Final team members migrate with full team support

#### Daily Standups Include:
- Containerization status updates
- Issue sharing and resolution
- Performance feedback
- Hybrid workflow coordination

### Phase 3: Full Migration (Complete Transition)
**Duration:** 1-2 weeks
**Goal:** Complete team migration and documentation updates

#### Week 1: Full Team Containerized
- All team members using docker-compose.dev.yml
- Legacy npm start workflows deprecated
- Team performance monitoring

#### Week 2: Optimization and Documentation
- Performance optimization based on team feedback
- Documentation updates and knowledge sharing
- Legacy workflow removal

## Individual Developer Migration

### Pre-Migration Checklist

- [ ] Docker Desktop updated and configured
- [ ] Latest code pulled from main branch
- [ ] Current work committed/stashed
- [ ] Understanding of new workflow from docs

### Migration Steps

#### Step 1: Stop Current Development Environment
```bash
# Stop Docker services
docker-compose down

# Stop any Node.js processes
pkill -f "npm start" || true

# Verify no processes on development ports
lsof -i :3000,8001 || echo "All clear!"
```

#### Step 2: Start Containerized Environment
```bash
# Start new containerized development environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Wait for all services to start (about 30 seconds)
# Watch logs for "System ready" messages
```

#### Step 3: Verify Development Experience
```bash
# Test frontend hot reload
# 1. Edit any file in frontend/src/
# 2. Verify changes appear in browser within 2 seconds
# 3. Verify React component state is preserved

# Test backend auto-reload
# 1. Edit any file in backend/app/
# 2. Verify FastAPI automatically reloads
# 3. Check API endpoint responds correctly
```

#### Step 4: Update Development Habits
**OLD Workflow:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d          # Backend services only
cd frontend && npm start      # Frontend natively
```

**NEW Workflow:**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up  # Everything containerized
```

### Common Migration Issues

#### Issue 1: Port Conflicts
**Symptoms:** Services fail to start, port binding errors
**Solution:**
```bash
# Find and stop conflicting processes
lsof -i :3000,8001,5432,6379,9200
kill <process-id>

# Or use the unified cleanup commands
make dev-clean  # If using Makefile from Story 5.1
```

#### Issue 2: Slow File Watching (Linux)
**Symptoms:** HMR not triggering, slow response to file changes
**Solution:**
```bash
./scripts/optimize-file-watching.sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml restart frontend
```

#### Issue 3: Memory/Resource Issues
**Symptoms:** Slow performance, container crashes
**Solution:**
1. Increase Docker Desktop memory allocation
2. Close unnecessary applications
3. Restart Docker Desktop

#### Issue 4: Build Cache Issues
**Symptoms:** Changes not reflected, stale dependencies
**Solution:**
```bash
# Clean rebuild
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build --no-cache frontend
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Individual Rollback
If containerized development doesn't work for a team member:

1. **Immediate fallback to hybrid mode:**
   ```bash
   # Stop containerized environment
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down

   # Start backend services only
   docker-compose up postgres redis elasticsearch -d

   # Start frontend natively
   cd frontend && npm start
   ```

2. **Report issues in #tech-support**
3. **Continue with hybrid workflow while issues are resolved**

### Team Rollback
If major issues affect team productivity:

1. **Team lead announces rollback**
2. **All team members revert to hybrid workflow**
3. **Document issues for future resolution**
4. **Schedule follow-up migration attempt**

## Questions and Feedback

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Will this slow down my development workflow?**
A: No, with proper configuration, the containerized environment performs identically to native development.

**Q: What if I need to install additional packages?**
A: Package changes require a container rebuild: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build frontend`

**Q: Can I still use my existing debugging tools?**
A: Yes, all debugging tools work with containerized development. See IDE integration section.
