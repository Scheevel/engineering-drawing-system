# Containerization Rollback Procedures

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive rollback procedures for the containerized development environment. Use these procedures when containerization issues affect productivity or when reverting to the hybrid Docker/native Node.js workflow is necessary.

## When to Execute Rollback

### Individual Rollback Triggers
- Containerized environment fails to start after multiple attempts
- Severe performance degradation (>5 second response times)
- HMR/hot reload completely non-functional after optimization attempts
- Critical debugging workflows broken in containerized environment
- Developer productivity significantly impacted for >2 hours

### Team Rollback Triggers
- Multiple team members experiencing blocking issues simultaneously
- Critical deployment blockers related to containerization
- Infrastructure issues preventing Docker operation
- Urgent hotfix requiring immediate native development workflow
- Team productivity down >50% for >4 hours

## Rollback Procedures

### Individual Developer Rollback

#### Step 1: Stop Containerized Environment
```bash
# Stop all containerized services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down

# Verify no containers running
docker ps | grep drawing || echo "All containers stopped"

# Clean up any dangling containers
docker-compose down  # Stop any legacy containers
```

#### Step 2: Start Hybrid Environment
```bash
# Start backend services only (containerized)
docker-compose up postgres redis elasticsearch -d

# Wait for services to be healthy (30-60 seconds)
docker-compose ps

# Verify service health
curl http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health  # Elasticsearch
redis-cli ping  # Redis should respond PONG
```

#### Step 3: Start Native Frontend
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install/update dependencies if needed
npm install

# Start native development server
npm start

# Verify frontend accessible at http://localhost:3000
```

#### Step 4: Verify Hybrid Environment
```bash
# Test API connectivity
curl http://localhost:8001/health

# Test frontend-backend communication
# Open browser to http://localhost:3000
# Verify API calls work in browser dev tools
```

#### Step 5: Document Issues
Create issue report including:
- Error messages encountered
- Performance metrics (if applicable)
- Steps attempted before rollback
- Environment details (OS, Docker version, etc.)

### Team Rollback

#### Emergency Team Rollback (Critical Issues)

**Team Lead Actions:**
1. **Announce rollback in #dev-team:**
   ```
   ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY ROLLBACK TO HYBRID DEVELOPMENT
   All developers: Stop containerized environment immediately
   Follow rollback procedures in containerization-rollback-procedures.md
   Expected resolution time: [X hours]
   ```

2. **Communication to stakeholders:**
   - Update project managers on development delays
   - Notify QA team of potential environment changes
   - Document impact on sprint commitments

**Developer Actions:**
1. Follow Individual Developer Rollback steps above
2. Report completion in #dev-team thread
3. Continue development with hybrid workflow
4. Assist team members with rollback issues

#### Planned Team Rollback (Non-Critical)

**Pre-Rollback Planning:**
1. Schedule rollback during low-impact time (standup, end of day)
2. Ensure all work is committed/pushed
3. Coordinate with QA for testing environment consistency

**Execution:**
1. Team announcement with 30-minute warning
2. Coordinated rollback at designated time
3. Verification that all team members are operational
4. Documentation of rollback reasons and lessons learned

## Specific Issue Rollbacks

### Performance Issue Rollback

**Symptoms:**
- Slow file watching (>5 second response to changes)
- Container resource exhaustion
- System becoming unresponsive

**Rollback Steps:**
```bash
# Immediate relief
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down

# Resource cleanup
docker system prune -f
docker volume prune -f

# Start hybrid environment with resource monitoring
docker-compose up postgres redis elasticsearch -d
cd frontend && npm start

# Monitor system resources
top -p $(pgrep -f "npm start")
```

### HMR Failure Rollback

**Symptoms:**
- Hot reload not working despite optimization
- Build errors in containerized environment
- Frontend development workflow broken

**Rollback Steps:**
```bash
# Stop containerized frontend
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml stop frontend

# Keep backend services running
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up postgres redis elasticsearch backend -d

# Start native frontend with known-good configuration
cd frontend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm start
```

### Network/Connectivity Rollback

**Symptoms:**
- Frontend cannot reach backend APIs
- Service discovery failures
- Database connection issues

**Rollback Steps:**
```bash
# Complete environment reset
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down -v
docker network prune -f

# Start with known-good network configuration
docker-compose up postgres redis elasticsearch backend -d

# Verify network connectivity
curl http://localhost:8001/health

# Start native frontend
cd frontend && npm start
```

### Communication Requirements

**Immediate (within 1 hour):**
- Report rollback completion in #dev-team
- Update task tracking systems (Jira, etc.)
- Inform dependent team members

**Daily:**
- Include rollback status in standup updates
- Report progress on issue resolution
- Coordinate re-containerization timeline

**Weekly:**
- Document lessons learned in team retrospective
- Update rollback procedures based on experience
- Plan improvements for next containerization attempt

## Recovery and Re-containerization

### Issue Resolution Process

1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Review error logs and documentation
   - Reproduce issues in isolated environment
   - Identify specific failure points

2. **Fix Development**
   - Create targeted fixes for identified issues
   - Test fixes in separate branch/environment
   - Document testing procedures

3. **Validation Testing**
   - Test fixes with affected developers
   - Verify performance meets requirements
   - Confirm all workflows functional

4. **Re-migration Planning**
   - Schedule re-containerization attempt
   - Prepare team communication
   - Have rollback procedures ready

### Gradual Re-adoption

**Phase 1: Single Developer Testing**
- One volunteer tests fixed containerized environment
- Daily check-ins on stability and performance
- Document any remaining issues

**Phase 2: Small Group Testing**
- 2-3 developers adopt fixed environment
- Peer support for issue resolution
- Refine procedures based on feedback

**Phase 3: Team Re-adoption**
- Full team migration with lessons learned
- Enhanced monitoring and support
- Backup rollback procedures ready

## Prevention Measures

### Pre-deployment Testing

**Environment Validation:**
```bash
# Test complete environment build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --abort-on-container-exit

# Performance benchmarking
time docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
# Should complete in <30 seconds

# HMR testing
# Change test file and verify <2 second response
```

**Resource Monitoring:**
```bash
# Check available resources
docker system df
free -h  # Linux
vm_stat | grep free  # macOS

# Test resource limits
docker stats  # Monitor during normal development
```

### Early Warning Systems

**Resource Monitoring:**
- Set up alerts for Docker resource usage >80%
- Monitor container startup times
- Track HMR response times

**Team Communication:**
- Daily development environment check-ins
- Weekly containerization health reviews
- Quarterly team feedback sessions

3. Measure rollback completion time
4. Identify procedure improvements
5. Update documentation based on findings

**Success Criteria:**
- Complete rollback in <15 minutes
- All team members operational immediately
- Zero data loss or work disruption
- Clear communication throughout process
