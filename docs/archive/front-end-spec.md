## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

**Functional Over Decorative:** All animations serve a clear purpose - providing feedback, indicating state changes, or guiding attention. No purely decorative motion that could slow down professional workflows.

**Performance-First:** Animations must maintain 60fps performance and include reduced-motion preferences for accessibility and professional environments.

**Immediate Feedback:** Every user action receives instant visual acknowledgment before any network operations begin.

**Spatial Consistency:** Animations respect the logical relationship between interface elements and maintain spatial continuity during transitions.

### Key Animations

- **Scope Indicator Updates:** Real-time number changes with subtle scale bounce for emphasis (Duration: 300ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55))

- **Progressive Disclosure Expansion:** Smooth height transition for advanced filter panel with staggered reveal of individual controls (Duration: 400ms, Easing: ease-in-out)

- **Search Results Loading:** Skeleton placeholder animation with subtle shimmer effect while results load (Duration: 1.5s loop, Easing: ease-in-out)

- **Filter Chip Addition/Removal:** Slide-in from left with scale emphasis, fade-out with slight scale down (Duration: 250ms, Easing: ease-out)

- **Component Row Hover:** Subtle background color shift and slight elevation increase for clear interaction feedback (Duration: 150ms, Easing: ease-out)

- **Confidence Score Updates:** Color transition with brief scale emphasis when confidence values change (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-out)

- **Sort Order Changes:** Gentle list item reordering with position transitions maintaining visual continuity (Duration: 500ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
