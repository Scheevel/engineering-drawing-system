- Sprint-based UX stories in backlog (separate from epic stories): [story-1.1](../stories/backlog/story-1.1-field-match-indicators.md), [story-1.2](../stories/backlog/story-1.2-scope-effectiveness-metrics.md), [story-2.1](../stories/backlog/story-2.1-data-overlap-analysis.md), [story-2.2](../stories/backlog/story-2.2-search-results-enhancement.md)

**ðŸ“Œ NOTE:** Epic numbering updated Oct 2025 to avoid confusion with archived "Epic 1: Multiple Piece Mark Instances" (completed Aug 2025, see [epic-1-completion-brief.md](../stories-archive/epic-1-completion-brief.md)). This epic defines the strategic search enhancement vision; related tactical work exists in other epics and sprints.

# Epic 2: Advanced Search Capabilities Enhancement

**Epic Goal:** Enhance the existing search functionality with scoped field selection, boolean operators, wildcard patterns, and project-based saved searches to improve search precision and workflow efficiency while maintaining complete backward compatibility.

**Integration Requirements:** Must integrate seamlessly with existing Elasticsearch/PostgreSQL search infrastructure, FastAPI backend services, and React/Material-UI frontend components without disrupting current search workflows.

## Story 2.1: Enhanced Search Query Foundation

As a **railroad bridge engineer**,  
I want **the search system to support enhanced query parsing and validation**,  
so that **I can use advanced search syntax without breaking existing simple searches**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **AC1:** System parses simple text queries exactly as before (backward compatibility)
2. **AC2:** System validates boolean operator syntax (AND, OR, NOT) and provides clear error messages
3. **AC3:** System sanitizes all search input to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities
4. **AC4:** Query parser handles quoted phrases ("wide flange beam") correctly
5. **AC5:** System gracefully handles malformed queries without crashing search functionality

### Integration Verification
**IV1:** All existing search functionality continues to work without modification  
**IV2:** Current search API endpoints return identical results for existing query patterns  
**IV3:** Search performance remains within established baseline metrics (<500ms)

## Story 2.2: Scoped Search Field Selection

As a **railroad bridge engineer**,  
I want **to limit my search to specific fields like piece marks only**,  
so that **I can find exact components without false positives from descriptions**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **AC1:** Search interface displays checkboxes for "Piece Marks", "Component Types", "Descriptions"
2. **AC2:** Piece Marks checkbox is selected by default for precision
3. **AC3:** Search results show active scope in results header ("Searching in: Piece Marks")
4. **AC4:** Scope selection persists for user session but doesn't affect saved search configurations
5. **AC5:** API accepts scope parameter while maintaining backward compatibility

### Integration Verification
**IV1:** Existing searches without scope parameter work identically to current behavior  
**IV2:** Search results UI layout remains consistent with current Material-UI patterns  
**IV3:** Component type filtering dropdown continues working alongside scope selection

## Story 2.3: Boolean Operators and Wildcard Support

As a **railroad bridge engineer**,  
I want **to use AND/OR/NOT operators and wildcard patterns in my searches**,  
so that **I can create precise queries like "C6* AND girder NOT aluminum"**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **AC1:** System supports AND operator ("beam AND steel" finds components containing both terms)
2. **AC2:** System supports OR operator ("plate OR angle" finds components containing either term)
3. **AC3:** System supports NOT operator ("steel NOT aluminum" excludes aluminum components)
4. **AC4:** System supports wildcard patterns ("C6*" matches all piece marks starting with C6)
5. **AC5:** System supports grouped logic with parentheses "(beam OR girder) AND W21"
6. **AC6:** Help tooltip displays syntax examples and real-time validation feedback

### Integration Verification
**IV1:** Simple text searches continue working without requiring operator syntax  
**IV2:** Search response format remains identical for API compatibility  
**IV3:** Boolean queries integrate properly with scope selection from previous story

## Story 2.4: Search Usage Analytics and Monitoring

As a **system administrator**,  
I want **to track search usage patterns and performance metrics**,  
so that **I can measure the enhancement's impact and optimize search capabilities**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **AC1:** System logs search queries, scope selections, and response times
2. **AC2:** Analytics track boolean query usage vs simple text searches
3. **AC3:** Performance monitoring alerts when search response times exceed thresholds
4. **AC4:** Usage patterns data helps identify common search workflows
5. **AC5:** Analytics integrate with existing logging and monitoring infrastructure

### Integration Verification
**IV1:** Analytics logging doesn't impact search performance or user experience  
**IV2:** Monitoring integrates with existing system health checks and alerting  
**IV3:** Data collection complies with existing privacy and retention policies

## Story 2.5: Project-Based Saved Searches

As a **railroad bridge engineer**,  
I want **to save my complex search configurations within project contexts**,  
so that **I can quickly rerun quality control searches without retyping complex queries**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **AC1:** "Save Search" button appears when search returns results
2. **AC2:** Save dialog allows naming search and selecting project context
3. **AC3:** Saved searches panel shows project-specific searches with one-click execution
4. **AC4:** Saved searches include query, scope, filters, and execution preview
5. **AC5:** Users can edit, delete, and reorder saved searches within projects
6. **AC6:** System limits maximum saved searches per project (50) to prevent database growth

### Integration Verification
**IV1:** Saved search execution produces identical results to manual query entry  
**IV2:** Project deletion properly cascades to remove associated saved searches  
**IV3:** Search interface remains responsive with large numbers of saved searches

## Story 2.6: Enhanced Search Interface Polish

As a **railroad bridge engineer**,  
I want **an intuitive and polished search interface that guides me through advanced features**,  
so that **I can leverage powerful search capabilities without feeling overwhelmed**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **AC1:** Search interface uses progressive disclosure (advanced features collapsed by default)
2. **AC2:** Syntax help is accessible but not intrusive (tooltip with examples)
3. **AC3:** Error messages provide actionable guidance for fixing query syntax
4. **AC4:** Search scope selection is clearly labeled and easy to understand
5. **AC5:** Saved searches panel integrates smoothly with existing Material-UI design
6. **AC6:** Mobile/tablet responsive design maintains usability across devices

### Integration Verification
**IV1:** Enhanced interface maintains existing accessibility standards and ARIA compliance  
**IV2:** Search page loading times remain within current performance expectations  
**IV3:** All existing keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility preserved
