# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The system shall provide scoped search control allowing users to limit searches to specific fields (piece_mark, component_type, description) with piece_mark as the default scope.

**FR2:** The system shall support boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) in search queries while maintaining backward compatibility with simple text searches.

**FR3:** The system shall support wildcard pattern matching using * and ? characters (e.g., "C6*" matches all piece marks starting with C6).

**FR4:** The system shall provide project-based saved searches allowing users to save, name, and reuse search configurations within project contexts.

**FR5:** The search interface shall display active search scope in results headers and provide intuitive controls for scope selection.

**FR6:** The system shall provide search syntax help and real-time query validation feedback through UI tooltips and indicators.

**FR7:** Saved searches shall be executable with one-click access and include search parameters, scope, and filters.

**FR8:** The system shall track search usage analytics to measure efficiency improvements and identify common search patterns for continuous optimization.

**FR9:** The system shall provide query syntax validation with helpful error messages for malformed boolean expressions and graceful handling of invalid syntax.

**FR10:** Saved searches shall include result preview functionality and handle cases where saved filters no longer match any data due to project changes.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** Search response times must not exceed current performance baseline (maintain sub-500ms response for typical queries).

**NFR2:** The enhancement must maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing search functionality and API endpoints.

**NFR3:** Boolean query parsing must handle malformed queries gracefully with clear error messages.

**NFR4:** The system must support concurrent saved search operations without data corruption.

**NFR5:** Search scope selection must be persistent per user session but not override saved search configurations.

**NFR6:** Boolean query parser must sanitize input to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities and ensure secure query execution.

**NFR7:** The system must maintain query performance with proper database indexing strategy for wildcard searches and complex boolean operations.

## Compatibility Requirements

**CR1:** All existing search API endpoints must continue functioning without modification for current integrations.

**CR2:** Database schema changes must be additive only (new saved_searches table) without modifying existing component tables.

**CR3:** Frontend search interface must maintain existing Material-UI design patterns and accessibility standards.

**CR4:** Integration with existing Elasticsearch and PostgreSQL fallback search must remain intact.
