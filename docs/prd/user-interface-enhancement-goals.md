# User Interface Enhancement Goals

## Integration with Existing UI

**Current Search Interface Analysis:**
The existing system uses React 18 + TypeScript + Material-UI with TextField components for search input, Select/Dropdown components for filtering, and Card/Paper components for results display, maintaining consistent spacing and typography from the Material-UI theme.

**New UI Integration Strategy:**
The enhanced search features will integrate using existing Material-UI components:
- **Search Scope Controls:** FormGroup with Checkbox components maintaining existing form patterns
- **Boolean Query Input:** Enhanced TextField with InputAdornment for syntax help icon
- **Saved Searches:** Collapsible Panel using Accordion component, consistent with existing expandable content
- **Query Validation:** Alert/Snackbar components for error feedback using existing notification patterns

## Modified/New Screens and Views

**Enhanced SearchPage.tsx:**
- **Search Control Panel:** New collapsible section above existing search input with scope selection checkboxes and query syntax help tooltip integration
- **Saved Searches Sidebar:** New collapsible panel with project-based saved search list, quick execute buttons, and save/edit/delete operations
- **Enhanced Results Header:** Modified existing results display with active search scope indicators and save search button when results exist

**No New Pages Required:** All enhancements integrate into existing SearchPage.tsx structure

## UI Consistency Requirements

**Material-UI Theme Compliance:**
- All new components must use existing theme colors, typography, and spacing
- Maintain consistent component sizing (48px button heights, 8px spacing grid)
- Follow existing elevation patterns for panels and modals
- Use consistent icon library (Material Icons) for new interface elements

**Accessibility Standards:**
- Scope selection checkboxes must have proper ARIA labels
- Boolean query syntax help must be screen reader compatible  
- Saved search operations must support keyboard navigation
- Query validation errors must announce properly to assistive technology

**Responsive Design Integration:**
- Search scope controls must adapt to mobile viewport constraints
- Saved searches panel must be mobile-friendly (drawer behavior on small screens)
- Enhanced search input must maintain usability on tablet/mobile devices
