# Session Recap - July 24, 2025

## Work Completed This Session

### 1. Drawing Toolbar Z-Index Fix

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Problem**: When zooming in on drawings, the drawing toolbar (containing zoom controls, component toggle, edit mode button) was disappearing under the main "Engineering Drawing Index System" title bar.

**Root Cause**: The DrawingViewer's toolbar Paper component had default z-index, while the main AppBar had `zIndex: theme.zIndex.drawer + 1`, causing the toolbar to be covered during zoom scroll operations.

#### Solution Implemented:
**File Modified**: `frontend/src/pages/DrawingViewer.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
- Updated Paper component styling for the drawing toolbar
- Added `position: 'sticky'` to keep toolbar positioned relative to viewport
- Set `top: 64` to position correctly below main AppBar (standard height)
- Applied `zIndex: theme.zIndex.appBar + 1` to ensure proper layering above main header
- Added explicit `backgroundColor: 'background.paper'` to prevent transparency issues

**Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
<Paper sx={{ 
  mb: 1, 
  position: 'sticky', 
  top: 64, 
  zIndex: (theme) => theme.zIndex.appBar + 1,
  backgroundColor: 'background.paper'
}}>
```

#### Result:
- Drawing toolbar now remains visible and accessible during all zoom operations
- Proper visual hierarchy maintained with main navigation
- No interference with existing drawing functionality
- Smooth user experience when interacting with drawings

### 2. Feature Planning Documentation

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Task**: Added comprehensive collapsible navigation menu feature documentation to FEATURE-REQUESTS.md based on user requirements and 2024 UX best practices research.

#### Research Conducted:
- **UX Best Practices**: Analyzed current industry standards for collapsible navigation
- **Material-UI Patterns**: Researched mini drawer implementation approaches
- **Accessibility Standards**: Documented proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation requirements
- **Responsive Design**: Planned breakpoint strategy for different screen sizes

#### Documentation Added:
**Comprehensive Feature Specification Including**:
- **UX Pattern Analysis**: Why avoid hamburger menu, benefits of mini drawer pattern
- **Implementation Plan**: State management, responsive behavior, accessibility features
- **User Experience Flow**: Hover expansion vs click toggle options
- **Technical Details**: Code examples, animation timing, breakpoint strategy
- **Success Criteria**: Performance metrics and usability requirements

**Key Sections**:
1. **Current State Analysis**: Assessment of existing navigation structure
2. **Implementation Plan**: 4-phase approach with specific file modifications
3. **Responsive Behavior**: Desktop/tablet/mobile adaptation strategy
4. **Accessibility & Performance**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, smooth animations
5. **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes for feature effectiveness
