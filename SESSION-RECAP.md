# Session Recap - July 24, 2025

## Work Completed This Session

### 1. Documentation Updates
- **Updated CLAUDE.md**: Enhanced project guidance with comprehensive architecture details, essential commands, and development workflows
- **Updated README.md**: Aligned project documentation with current codebase structure
- **Created comprehensive feature documentation**: Established FEATURE-REQUESTS.md with detailed implementation plans

### 2. Right-Click Marker Creation Feature Implementation

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Summary**: Implemented a streamlined workflow allowing users to create markers anywhere on drawings through right-click context menus, without requiring edit mode activation.

#### Files Modified:
- `/Users/scheevel/Workstream/EVALUATIONS/engineering-drawing-system-standalone/frontend/src/App.tsx`
- `/Users/scheevel/Workstream/EVALUATIONS/engineering-drawing-system-standalone/frontend/src/components/drawing/ComponentCreationDialog.tsx`
- `/Users/scheevel/Workstream/EVALUATIONS/engineering-drawing-system-standalone/frontend/src/components/drawing/DrawingContextMenu.tsx`
- `/Users/scheevel/Workstream/EVALUATIONS/engineering-drawing-system-standalone/frontend/src/pages/DrawingViewer.tsx`

#### Key Enhancements:

**Context Menu Enhancement** (DrawingContextMenu.tsx):
- Added mode-aware menu options
- Non-edit mode shows "Create Marker Here" and "View Component Details"
- Edit mode shows full operations (edit, delete, duplicate, verify)
- Added visual hint for additional options in edit mode

**Quick Marker Creation** (ComponentCreationDialog.tsx):
- Implemented simplified "Quick Mode" for fast marker creation
- Only piece mark field required for quick creation
- Smart defaults: Component type = "Generic", quantity = 1
- Auto-sets manual_creation = true and review_status = 'pending'

**Visual Differentiation System** (DrawingViewer.tsx):
- Color-coded markers:
  - üü¢ Green: Verified components
  - üü† Orange: Pending review markers
  - üî¥ Red: Highlighted/selected
- Dashed borders for pending markers
- "P" badge indicator on unverified markers

**Removed Edit Mode Restriction**:
- Right-click context menu available in any mode
- Destructive operations still protected by edit mode requirement
- Improved user experience with no mode switching needed

#### User Experience Improvements:
1. **Faster Workflow**: Single right-click to create markers
2. **Clear Visual Feedback**: Immediate visual distinction between marker states
3. **Intuitive Interface**: Color coding matches user expectations
4. **Maintained Security**: Edit operations still require explicit edit mode

### 3. Git Management
