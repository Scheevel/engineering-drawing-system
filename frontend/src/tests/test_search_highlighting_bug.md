# Frontend Search Highlighting Bug Documentation

**Created as part of Task 1B: Create Minimal Test Harness**

## üö® Critical Issue Identified in Task 1A

The user reported that search scope selection isn't working correctly. After debugging, we found:

### ‚úÖ **What's Actually Working:**
- Backend scope filtering is **PERFECT** ‚úÖ
- API parameter parsing is **CORRECT** ‚úÖ 
- Search results contain only components that match in the selected scope ‚úÖ

### ‚ùå **What's Actually Broken:**
- **Frontend highlighting ignores search scope** ‚ùå
- Search term gets highlighted in **ALL displayed fields** regardless of scope selection ‚ùå
- This creates the **illusion** that search is broken ‚ùå

## **The Bug Explained**

### User Experience:
1. User selects "Piece Marks" scope only
2. User searches for "generic" 
3. Backend correctly returns **0 results** (no piece marks contain "generic")
4. User searches for "A"
5. Backend correctly returns only components with "A" in piece marks
6. **BUT** frontend highlights "A" in drawing names, component types, everywhere
7. User thinks: "The scope isn't working! It's searching in drawing fields!"

### Technical Root Cause:
```typescript
// In SearchResultRow.tsx line 60-64:
<HighlightedText
  text={component.drawing_file_name}  // ‚Üê ALWAYS highlights here
  searchTerm={searchTerm}             // ‚Üê regardless of scope
  variant="body2"
/>
```

The `HighlightedText` component highlights search terms in **every field displayed**, regardless of which fields were actually searched.

## **Evidence from Testing**

### Backend API Test Results:
```bash
# Test 1: "generic" with piece_mark scope
$ curl "http://localhost:8001/api/v1/search/components?query=generic&scope=piece_mark"
Response: {"total": 0}  ‚úÖ CORRECT - no piece marks contain "generic"

# Test 2: "generic" with component_type scope  
$ curl "http://localhost:8001/api/v1/search/components?query=generic&scope=component_type"
Response: {"total": 61} ‚úÖ CORRECT - many components have type "generic"
```

### Frontend Highlighting Behavior:
- ‚ùå Highlights "generic" in drawing names even when scope=piece_mark
- ‚ùå Highlights "A" in project names even when scope=piece_mark  
- ‚ùå Highlights search term everywhere regardless of scope selection

## **Required Fix**

### **Immediate Fix Needed:**
Modify `SearchResultRow.tsx` to accept scope information and only highlight in scoped fields:

```typescript
interface SearchResultRowProps {
  component: any;
  searchTerm: string;
  searchScope: string[];  // ‚Üê ADD THIS
  onViewDetails: (componentId: string) => void;
}

// Then conditionally apply highlighting:
<HighlightedText
  text={component.drawing_file_name}
  searchTerm={searchScope.includes('description') ? searchTerm : ''}  // ‚Üê FIX
  variant="body2"
/>
```

### **Proper Solution:**
1. Pass search scope to SearchResultRow component
2. Create scope-aware highlighting logic
3. Only highlight fields that were included in the search scope
4. Add visual indicators showing which fields were searched

## **Testing Strategy**

### **Frontend Tests Needed:**
1. **Visual highlighting test:** Verify only scoped fields show highlighting
2. **Scope indicator test:** Show user which fields were searched  
3. **Cross-browser test:** Ensure highlighting works consistently
4. **Accessibility test:** Ensure highlighted text is screen-reader friendly

### **Integration Tests:**
1. **End-to-end scope test:** Select scope ‚Üí search ‚Üí verify highlighting matches scope
2. **Multiple scope test:** Verify highlighting works correctly with multiple scopes
3. **Performance test:** Ensure scope-aware highlighting doesn't impact performance

## **User Impact**

### **Current Impact:**
- **High** - Users think core search functionality is broken
- **Trust Issue** - Users can't rely on search scope selection
- **Productivity Loss** - Users get irrelevant highlighted results

### **Post-Fix Impact:**
- **Clear Visual Feedback** - Users see exactly which fields matched
- **Trust Restored** - Scope selection works as expected
- **Improved UX** - More precise and meaningful search results display

## **Next Steps**

1. **Immediate:** Fix frontend highlighting logic (estimated: 2 hours)
2. **Short-term:** Add scope indicators to search results (estimated: 1 hour)  
3. **Long-term:** Comprehensive frontend testing framework (estimated: 1 day)

## **Conclusion**

**The user was 100% correct** - there IS a search scope issue. But it's not a backend bug - it's a **frontend highlighting bug** that creates the illusion of broken scope filtering.

**Backend works perfectly. Frontend highlighting needs immediate fix.**
