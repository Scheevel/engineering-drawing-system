/**
 * QA Investigation: Data Overlap Hypothesis
 * 
 * User Issue: "When I change scope from 'Piece Marks' to 'Component Types' 
 * nothing changes except for the highlighting on screen."
 * 
 * QA HYPOTHESIS: The issue may not be scope filtering failure, but rather 
 * DATA OVERLAP - the same search terms appear in multiple fields in the database.
 * 
 * For example, searching for "beam" might return the same components because:
 * - piece_mark: "BEAM-01"  
 * - component_type: "beam"
 * - description: "steel beam structure"
 * 
 * All three fields contain "beam", so scope filtering appears broken when it's actually working correctly!
